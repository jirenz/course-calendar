DESCRIPTION:Why do countries present public policies that are stable and coherent overtime, whereas others policies tend to be more volatile and inconsistent? This course applies theoretical tools of comparative political economy to investigate the functioning of political institutions, political systems and the policymaking process, and their effect on public policies and on economic performance with special focus on Latin America. The goal of the course, therefore, is for students to become acquainted with the diversity of institutional combinations of Latin American countries and their effect on the profile of public policies.
