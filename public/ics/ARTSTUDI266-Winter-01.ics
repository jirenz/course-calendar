DESCRIPTION:In this upper level studio course, students will experiment with video and computational outputs embedded in physical scenarios. What new physical formats are made possible by contemporary screen and projection-mapping technologies? How can we make expressive use of LCD screens, pico projectors, i-pad arrays, and LEDs?  The class will address the screen as sculptural medium by examining established artists like Nam June Paik, Michael Snow, Tony Oursler, and Pippilotti Rist, as well as exploring emerging contemporary artists tackling this medium. Prerequisites include one of the following: Intro to Digital/Physical Design, Embodied Interfaces, Media Archaeologies, Making it with Arduino, Digital Art 1, Electronic Art or permission of instructor.
