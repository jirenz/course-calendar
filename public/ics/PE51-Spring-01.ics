DESCRIPTION:In this class you will learn how to relax in the water, breath effectively, float and tread, swim 4-5 strokes (freestyle, backstroke, sidestroke, elementary backstroke, and breaststroke, time permitting), jump in the water from the deck, use swimming equipment (kickboards, pull buoys, fins) and swim across a 25- yard pool.  This course will utilize class discussions, class assignments, and student participation to enable students to: (1) Swim each stroke with proper form and technique (2) Develop an understanding of how to stay healthy and conditioned to further enhance swim strokes and decrease the risk of injuries. (3) Develop a positive attitude toward wellness and physical activity, which will facilitate a healthy lifestyle. nIf you have fear or anxiety in the water, consider taking the PE 128 Confidence in Water class.  If you can swim across a 25 yard pool, you should take the PE 52: Intermediate Swim class. Prerequisite: non-swimmer, unable to swim across a 25 yard pool.
