DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 565) This survey course will provide a foundation in immigration law, the system of admission and removal, and the constitutional principles governing the regulation and rights of noncitizens. The course will also explore selected contemporary topics concerning immigrants' rights and immigration reform drawing on the instructor's extensive litigation to advance the constitutional and civil rights of noncitizens and service as a senior immigration advisor in the Obama administration. We will examine some current issues such as immigration detention; Trump executive orders; federal enforcement authority; state and local regulation of immigrants; constitutional prohibitions on 'alienage' discrimination; habeas corpus and Article III judicial review of removal orders; and the intersection of criminal and immigration law.  Guest speakers may be invited for some topics. No prior course or background in immigration law is expected. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance (10%), final exam (90%).
