LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Whether you are a scientist, a historian, a medical student, a journalist, an entrepreneur, or a designer, in the near future you will find yourself telling your story to potential collaborators, funders, employers, and others. You can no longer rely on a resum&eacute; or a transcript to show a comprehensive range of your skills and experiences. As more work and workplaces become project-based, these formats fall short of revealing the potential you have. This class will help you create a portfolio&iquest;in whatever form is relevant to your field&iquest;that communicates your value and your values to prospective collaborators or employers. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. This class will be most useful to students who have a future path in mind, regardless of when that will begin. Application required, see dschool.stanford.edu/classes for more information.
