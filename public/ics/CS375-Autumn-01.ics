DESCRIPTION:Introduction to designing, building, and training neural networks for modeling brain and behavioral data, including: deep convolutional neural network models of sensory systems (vision, audition, somatosensation); recurrent neural networks for dynamics, memory and attention; integration of variational and generative methods for cognitive modeling; and methods and metrics for comparing such models to real-world neural data.  Attention will be given both to established methods as well as cutting-edge techniques.  Students will learn conceptual bases for deep neural network models, and will also implement learn to implement and train large-scale models in Tensorflow using GPUs.  Requirements:  Fluency in Unix shell and Python programming, familiarity with differential equations, linear algebra, and probability theory, and one or more courses in cognitive or systems neuroscience.
