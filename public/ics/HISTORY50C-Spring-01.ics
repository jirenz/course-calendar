DESCRIPTION:(Same as HISTORY 150C. History majors and others taking 5 units, register for 150C.) Covering the past century, this course will survey U.S. politics, culture, and social movements, tracing three recurrent themes: the growth of the federal government and ensuing political debates about its role; the development of the United States into a world power; and the contested expansion of American democracy.  Lectures meet Mon, Tues, Wed.  This is a Massive Multiplayer Humanities course: students will participate in two archival workshops held on Thursdays.  Research workshops for 5 credit students will also be held on Thursdays. Suitable for non-majors and majors alike.  Three and five credit options, with the choice of a research paper or proposal for 5 credit students.
