DESCRIPTION:High-performance network system design. Students will work in teams of two to build a fully functioning Internet router. Students will design the control plane in C on a linux host and will design the data plane in the new P4 language on the NetFPGA 4 x 10GE switch. For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the other teams by building a small scale datacenter topology. In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router), Verilog experience for one member of each team is helpful but not required. Advanced material is often taught for the first time as a topics course, perhaps by a faculty member visiting from another institution. May be repeated for credit.
