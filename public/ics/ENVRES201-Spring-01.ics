DESCRIPTION:Non-profit organizations seeking to achieve social and environmental change often run outreach and education programs to engage community members in their cause. Effective application of social science theory and methods may improve the design and evaluation of such community engagement programs. In this class, we partner with environmental and social justice organizations in the Bay Area to explore two questions: 1) How can recent findings from the social sciences be applied to design more effective community engagement programs ? 2) How can we rigorously evaluate outreach and education programs to ensure they are achieving the desired objectives? The course will include an overview of key theories from psychology, sociology, and education, field trips to partnering organizations, and a term-long community-engaged research project focused on designing and/or evaluating a local outreach or educational program that is meant to achieve social and environmental change.
