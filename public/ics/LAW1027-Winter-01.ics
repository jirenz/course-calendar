DESCRIPTION:(Formerly 591)  This course uses Silicon Valley's venture capital process as a template to examine the legal regime governing capital formation in the United States. The course tracks financing from the earliest angel investing rounds, through billion dollar private placements, initial public offerings (IPO's), and subsequent governance as a publicly traded firm. The course also explores emerging crowd-funding markets, secondary market mechanisms for trading privately held shares, and the operation of Rule 144A, which allows large foreign firms to raise significant amounts from US institutional investors without ever registering with the SEC. The course relies extensively on recent transactions including the Alibaba , Facebook, and Square IPOs, and Uber private placements. Students interested in a more complete appreciation of the securities regulation process are advised also to take the Spring Securities Litigation course. Elements used in grading: Final exam.
