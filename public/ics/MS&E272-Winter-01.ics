DESCRIPTION:How do you create a start-up outside of the U.S.? What are the unique issues involved in creating a successful startup in emerging economies such as China or India? What is entrepreneurial leadership in a venture that spans country borders? Is Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurship possible in other places? How does an entrepreneur act differently when creating a company in a less-developed institutional environment? Learn through forming teams, a mentor-guided startup project focused on developing students' startups in international markets, case studies, research on the international aspects of the entrepreneurial process, and networking with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who work across borders. For graduate students only, with a preference for engineering and science majors who seek to understand the formation of high-impact start-ups in emerging economy contexts. Limited enrollment.
