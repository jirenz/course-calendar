DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 242)  This is a basic course in corporation law and provides a foundation for advanced business courses. The course examines the role of law in structuring economic relationships among shareholders, management, creditors, and other participants in modern business corporations. Some background in accounting and corporate finance is helpful, but not required. The course briefly considers basic theories of the firm, the reasons for incorporation of a business enterprise, and agency theory. The course then turns to management and control of the corporation, the actions of directors and officers, and the distribution of powers within the corporate structure more generally. The role of shareholders is examined next, and we devote substantial attention to the fiduciary duties of directors and controlling shareholders. Finally, we closely examine transactions in corporate control and consider the permissible scope of anti-takeover devices.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.
