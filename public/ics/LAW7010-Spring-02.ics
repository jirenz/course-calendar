DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 255)  This course examines various aspects of the Fourteenth Amendment, with special attention paid to equal protection and substantive due process. We will examine many contested constitutional questions, including, for example: How did gay and lesbian relationships go so quickly from being subject to criminal prohibition to being eligible for marriage? What justifies the Supreme Court's striking down a law mandating segregated schools, when it had upheld an analogous law half a century earlier?  Must the law treat all individuals identically, or may and should it grant special protections to members of historically disadvantaged groups?  To what sources might (and should) a judge look to give content to vague constitutional terms like &quot;equal protection&quot; and &quot;due process&quot;? How can we distinguish &quot;law&quot; from &quot;politics&quot; in this area? Readings will include judicial opinions and some scholarly commentary. Class discussion will be supplemented with group exercises of various sorts. Elements used in grading: Class participation and exam.  ENROLLMENT REQUEST FORM:  To apply for this course, students must complete and submit the Enrollment Request Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms).  See Enrollment Request Form for instructions and submission deadline.
