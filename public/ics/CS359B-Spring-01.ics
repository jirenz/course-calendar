DESCRIPTION:This project-based class focuses on understanding the elements of blockchain application development. Students will learn methods to design, implement and evaluate programs on fault tolerant cryptocurrency systems. Such systems could be viewed as a giant global slow distributed computer with public storage that can communicate to the real world through oracles. Alongside lectures, there will be a quarter-long project where students design, implement and evaluate a novel distributed application on a modern blockchain, such as the ones of the Ethereum or NEO cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin blockchain will be also briefly discussed as background knowledge. Enrollment is competitive, so potential students must complete an application; see http://cs359b.stanford.edu for details. Recommended: CS 251 or 255. Prerequisites: CS 110, CS 142, or permission by the instructor.
