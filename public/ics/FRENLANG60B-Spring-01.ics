LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Students are expected to have a conversational level of French. The content of the class varies depending on what students want to learn, as well as what they present on. The purpose of the class is for students to take the time to exercise and practice their french in conversation with their peers. A requirement of the class is for each student to give a 5-7 min. presentation in french about anything related to french culture. These presentations are an important part of Frenlang 60B and 60C, as they allow students to challenge themselves and speak about a topic in a foreign language. They also serve as a starting point for topics of conversation as we follow each presentation with some questions and small group discussions.
