DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite:&nbsp;PWR 1. In this course, we will reinforce our understanding of the research writing process and develop oral communication skills to investigate changes in digital language use. This course also examines the extent to which our daily lives have become deeply dependent on our usage of personal electronic devices for online communication. Is our attachment to technology truly limiting the quality of our conversations? Or could such interactions provide a means for introverts to better interact with others?  For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
