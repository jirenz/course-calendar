DESCRIPTION:Getting from &quot;strategic insight&quot; to &quot;desired outcome&quot; (achieving the right result) continues to be a core challenge for many organizations and leaders.  In this course, we develop a framework and approach for the &quot;insight to outcome&quot; sequence, study some of the key levers available to managers, and learn from some common pitfalls.  The bulk of the course will be devoted to the practical application of the approach to a number of important business processes, such as merger integration, corporate and business unit transformation, and strategy development.  Some class sessions will involve class visits by topical experts in these applications. nnThe course is designed for second-year MBAs. It will appeal to students interested in an exploratory course - more of a &quot;how to think about it&quot; course than a &quot;toolkit&quot; course.  Grades will be based on class participation and a group project.nnClass size is limited to 30.
