DESCRIPTION:Instructor Young Jean Lee is a playwright and director who will have two plays premiering on Broadway in 2018-2019. This workshop will guide students through the process of writing a full-length play, and will focus on helping students to find their own voices. Students will be required to write every week and share their work with the class, completing a full-length first draft by the end of the term. This class will be geared towards generating new material, rather than on editing in response to critiques, which will be covered in a spring course, EDITING A FULL-LENGTH PLAY. Topics to be discussed: the relationship between naturalistic and experimental theater; writing about unfamiliar subjects; and writing what you are afraid to write. Students must contact the instructor at yjl@stanford.edu ASAP in order to obtain an application for the class, which will be due on December 1.
