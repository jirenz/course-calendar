DESCRIPTION:Why was Salvador Dal&iacute; fascinated with the architecture of Gaud&iacute;? Why did Andr&eacute; Breton, Paul &Eacute;luard and Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca visit Barcelona? Moreover, why did Catalonia become such an important cradle for Surrealism? Why is the (Catalan) landscape such a relevant presence in the work of Mir&oacute; and Dal&iacute;? Through a critical analysis and discussion of selected works of art and literature, this seminar focuses and follows the trajectories of Mir&oacute; and Dal&iacute;, from Barcelona to Paris to New York, and explores the role of their Catalan background as a potentially essential factor in their own contributions to Surrealism and the reception of their work. The course will provide the materials and guide the student to conduct research on a specific work(s) of art, architecture, literature or cinema either by Mir&oacute;, Dal&iacute; or one of his peers in relation to their cultural, social and political context. The course is intended for graduate students in Iberian and Comparative Literature, Art History, Cultural Studies, and related fields. Taught in English by Jordi Falg&agrave;s i Casanovas.
