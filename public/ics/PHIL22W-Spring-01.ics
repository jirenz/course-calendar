DESCRIPTION:Grad-led tutorial. If you are Monica's friend and the appropriate circumstances arise, you presumably have a reason to help her move into her new apartment. If you are a practicing Muslim, it seems likely you have a reason to answer the call to prayer. And if you are a judge, it would be difficult to deny that you have a reason to apply the law impartially in the pursuit of justice. For the sake of argument let us grant that we in fact have these reasons. The question this tutorial addresses is: In what sense do we have them because of who we are? We will examine theories that posit a necessary link between normativity and motivation and investigate a) whether they represent the most plausible way of cashing out the intuition that our reasons substantively depend on who we are, and b) whether they are plausible in their own right. Authors will include Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, Bernard Williams, Harry Frankfurt, Christine Korsgaard, and Michael Smith.
