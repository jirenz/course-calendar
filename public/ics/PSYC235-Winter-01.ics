DESCRIPTION:Dr. William Dement created Sleep and Dreams in 1971, the world&iquest;s first university undergraduate-level course on the science of sleep.  Now as an emeritus professor, he continues to be actively involved in the course teaching many of the lectures and sometimes driving students to class in his golf cart!  The course is designed to impart essential knowledge of the neuroscience of sleep and covers how sleep affects our daily lives.  The course covers normal sleep and dreams, as well as common sleep disorders.  Course content empowers students to make educated decisions concerning sleep and alertness for the rest of their lives and shapes students' attitudes about the importance of sleep.  Students will keep track of their sleep patterns during the course. They will also participate in an outreach project to help improve awareness of the importance of sleep heath in our community.  Undergraduates must enroll in PSYC 135, while graduate students should enroll in PSYC 235.
