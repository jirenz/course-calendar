DESCRIPTION:Although often undifferentiated, post-Soviet societies demonstrate a variety of transformation trajectories and diverse approaches to identity and memory politics. This course draws on cases from Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the Baltic States, the Caucasus, Russia, and Kazakhstan to explore the sociocultural transformation of post-Soviet countries in comparative perspective. We will analyze the construction of new identities and related issues, including language politics and collective memory and mythscapes as well as their media discourses.  We will also examine political and civic participation in reforms, including citizens&iquest; value orientations and attitudes towards human rights and the rule of law.
