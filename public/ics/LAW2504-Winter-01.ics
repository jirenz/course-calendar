DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 603)  Environmental law is critically important and endlessly fascinating.  In this course, we will look at the major statutes and policies used, at both the federal and state levels, to protect humans and the environment against exposure to harmful substances, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Superfund, the Resource Conservation &amp; Recovery Act, and laws designed to regulate toxic substances.  This class will also examine the challenges of global air pollution, including climate change and ozone depletion.  The class will look not only at the substance of these laws and policies, but also at enforcement challenges, alternative legal mechanisms for advancing environmental policies (such as voter initiatives and common-law actions), the role of market mechanisms in addressing environmental problems, and constitutional restrictions on environmental regulation.  As part of the class, students will engage in a series of situational case studies designed to provide a better sense of the real-world issues faced by environmental lawyers and to teach students the skills and tactics needed to solve those issues.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.
