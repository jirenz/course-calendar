DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1.  Why do we listen? How do we listen to learn, to understand? And to whom do we listen? And how does listening impact how we orient ourselves in the world? Rhetorical listening has been central to feminist rhetorical praxis, which has traditionally focused on the rescue, recovery, and (re)inscription of non-majority cultures and communities into the rhetorical tradition. In short, rhetorical listening asks us to reconsider the role listening plays, and the values which we ascribe to listening, in processes of knowledge construction inside and outside the academy.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
