DESCRIPTION:Religion has long been a central preoccupation for ethnographers interested in the formation and function ofnsocial groups. Much ethnography of religion focuses on rituals and practices of inscription -- exploring the waysnin which religious communities turn concepts into practices (and vice versa) that reinscribe members within ancollective. These efforts take many forms, but they are, at their core, educational, insofar as they serve as anninformal curriculum for the acquisition and rehearsal of theological, communal, ritual, textual, and embodiednforms. This seminar will focus on the educational aspects central of ethnographic approaches to the study ofnreligion, looking into and beyond schools.
