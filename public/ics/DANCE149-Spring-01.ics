DESCRIPTION:Advanced Ballet at Stanford is offered for students who are interested in rigorous, complex, and artistically compelling ballet training.  The class focuses on technique, but in the broad sense of how ballet as a movement system can be used for a wide range of dance disciplines.  The class honors the historical training legacy that defines classical ballet, but is in no way shackled to that history in an antiquated fashion.  The students are encouraged to explore the form as artists, to question its foundations, and find their own sense of agency within classical dance.  Students with a strong background in ballet are encouraged to come, but also students with less ballet training are welcome as long as they have an email dialog with the lecturer beforehand.  Any questions can be directed to Lecturer Alex Ketley at aketley@stanford.edu
