DESCRIPTION:This seminar serves as an orientation to the history of &iquest;premodern&iquest; Korea through an examination of its historiography. It interrogates how scholars have situated their research questions within existing historiography and the *probl&eacute;matiques* that emerge from this engagement. Students will therefore read earlier, field-defining scholarship alongside more recent, emerging scholarship as a way to understand the development of premodern Korean history as a field. In particular, the course will critically examine the &iquest;premodern&iquest;/&iquest;modern&iquest; distinction and evaluate how questions in search of &iquest;modernity&iquest; and narratives of &iquest;modernization&iquest; have driven research and debates, whether explicitly or implicitly, on the &iquest;premodern&iquest; past. Topics to be covered include identity and nationalism, political and social history, gender and law, foreign relations and diplomacy, and economic and social &iquest;modernization.&iquest;nnAll required readings in English. Ability to read Korean or another Asian language welcome but not required.
