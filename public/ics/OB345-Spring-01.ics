LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The ability to coach others is an often over-looked core competency for leaders. This course will give second year MBA and MSx students an opportunity to learn the fundamental skills of coaching, so they can become coaching managers. This course is designed to be very experiential. While conceptual frameworks will be introduced through readings, lectures, demonstrations and discussions, the only real way to learn coaching skills is to both practice coaching, and to be coached. Every class session will provide opportunities to do both: coach and be coached. Because the in-class coaching practice will not be role plays but will actually be real coaching sessions between students, this course will demand a high level of engagement and participation from each student. While OB374 is not required, we highly recommend students take OB374 either previously or concurrently with taking this course in order to maximize your learning.
