DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 292)  This class will cover the basics of the gift and estate tax system and estate planning principles.  With these fundamentals, the course will then examine basic and advanced estate planning and wealth transfer techniques, including wills, various types of trusts, titling property, gifts during lifetime, charitable vehicles, handling closely held businesses and valuation matters--with an emphasis on how to use these tools in planning an estate to meet the objectives of a couple or individual.  Probate of an estate, durable power of attorneys, conservatorships, and planning for other life situations will be explored.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation (is a small factor and only in the positive direction) and final open book exam.
