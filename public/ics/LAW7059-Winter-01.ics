DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 301)  This course will cover the basic substantive and procedural aspects of the enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the U.S. economy today. After a brief introduction to the origin and history of collective bargaining laws, the course will examine how the protections and obligations of the NLRA actually operate in the modern workplace. Coverage will include legal issues in union organizing, union recognition, collective bargaining and workplace governance in a union context. The course will also emphasize the role of the NLRA in the non-union workplace, addressing such issues as the right to speak out at work (and limits thereon), and the rights of employees to engage in other concerted activity to advance their interests. Finally, the course will address the issue of arbitration of employment disputes in both the union and non-union workplace.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Written Assignments.
