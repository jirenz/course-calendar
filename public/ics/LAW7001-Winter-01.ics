DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 238)  Federal, state and local administrative agencies affect vast areas of life and law practice.  Their domain includes regulation of the environment, immigration, professional licensing, and many other areas of the economy as well as the provision of government benefits. It's fair to say that today we live in an administrative state -- which some would like to deconstruct. Administrative law is about the procedures (mostly prescribed by the federal and state Administrative Procedure Acts as well as constitutional due process) that agencies must follow when they adopt regulations or adjudicate disputes. It's also about the legislative, executive, and judicial checks and balances that control the agencies.  In particular, the course explores the nature and scope of judicial review of agency action. Elements used in grading: Final Exam (essay, three hours, open book).
