DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 359)  This course will explore various tax policy issues. In past years, the issues we've explored have included the carbon tax, health care, social security, consumption tax, tax compliance, tax shelters and school financing.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on either (A) class participation and memos responding to the discussion questions for any three of the sessions or (B) class participation and a research paper on a topic of your choosing (subject to instructor approval). Option B is Research (R) credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.
