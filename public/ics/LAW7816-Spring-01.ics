DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 674)  Building on the skills developed in Federal Litigation, this course will give students additional practice with legal analysis, argument structure, and writing in either the pre-trial or appellate litigation context. Students will draft an office memo and a brief.  Students also will complete short writing exercises in class to practice skills such as omitting surplus words, preferring active voice, using concrete words, punctuating carefully, etc. The goals of this class are to help students organize facts and principles in a succinct and logical way, to deepen their understanding of legal reasoning and writing, and to hone their advocacy skills. The course should appeal to students interested in litigation practice and those wishing to strengthen their writing.  Special Instructions:  Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of priority and Degree of Study.  Elements used in grading: Written work, class participation, and attendance.
