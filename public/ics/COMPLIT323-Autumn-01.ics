DESCRIPTION:The seminar questions common ideas about early-modern Europe and the &quot;modernity&quot; then established. It looks at Africa, the Americas and Europe as equal partners in making what is now called the Renaissance. Among these ideas are those of the &quot;subject&quot; and the &quot;other,&quot; of &quot;history,&quot; fiction, &quot;science,&quot;  &quot;literature,&quot; etc. We will discuss issues of cultural exchange; colonialism and postcolonialism; history and orature; the &quot;fictive imagination&quot; and the politics of &quot;literature&quot;; formations of &quot;methodical&quot; knowledge; and the very idea of Renaissance and all it entails for people's still-normative understanding of Euro-modernity. We will do this chiefly through texts from Africa and the Americas, as well as Spanish, English and French Europe. We look at invasion, cultural imposition, indigenous cultures and back-formation of European culture, and the aforementioned concepts and issues as they set certain kinds of cultural creations in place whose continuing dominance and supposed &quot;universality&quot; needs querying.
