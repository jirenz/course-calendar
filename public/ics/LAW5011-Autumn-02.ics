DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 583)  The past few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties and other agreements with investment-related provisions (such as NAFTA), followed by a sharp rise in the number of disputes between private investors and sovereign states pursuant to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions. The rise of international investment arbitration has generated a new and exciting practice area in global law firms. This course will cover four broad areas: (I) the historical and policy origins of international investment law; (II) the substantive obligations and standards governing the investor-state relationship; (III) the investor-state arbitration process; and (IV) current controversies over the legitimacy and desirability of ISDS. The course uses materials from international investment treaty texts, case law, and commentaries to enable students to evaluate and apply legal doctrine to future situations. Students may choose between a series of weekly response papers or a larger research paper, and will serve as discussion facilitators along with the instructors. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructors. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance and paper(s).
