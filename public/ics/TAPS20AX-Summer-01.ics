LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Set on Chicag's South Side, the plot revolves around the divergent dreams and conflicts within three generations of the Younger family: son Walter Lee, his wife Ruth, his sister Beneatha, his son Travis, and matriarch Lena. When her deceased husband's insurance money comes through, Mama Lena dreams of moving to a new home and a better neighborhood in Chicago. Walter Lee, a chauffeur, has other plans: buying a liquor store and being his own man. Beneatha dreams of medical school. The tensions and prejudice they face form this seminal American drama. The Younger family&iquest;s heroic struggle to retain dignity in a harsh and changing world is a searing and timeless document of hope and inspiration.nnStudents cast in the production must enroll in the associated Arts Intensive course; the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education will cover tuition costs associated with enrollment. Cast members and other key creative roles will be offered two units of credit through the Arts Intensive program and will be housed on campus for rehearsals which start during the Arts Intensive program period (September 4-21, 2018) and continue into Fall quarter, culminating in performances in Roble Studio Theater on October 25-27 and November 1-3, 2018.)
