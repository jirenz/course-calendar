DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 654)  This workshop seminar will provide students with the opportunity to examine and critique cutting-edge research and work in the field of law and the biosciences presented by different speakers from Stanford and elsewhere. Although it is open to all students, the seminar is designed especially for those with an interest in the field who wish to stay abreast of current issues, work, and ideas. In each class, an academic expert, policy maker, or practitioner will present his or her current research or work and engage in a robust discussion. Students may take this class for one or two units. It will meet eight times for 2 hours, 15 minutes per session; students will need to attend at least six of the eight sessions and, for each session attended, write a reflection piece of roughly three double-spaced pages, due just before the speaker's presentation. The class is open to first-year Law School students. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and written assignments.
