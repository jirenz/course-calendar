DESCRIPTION:A course dedicated to creating at the crossroads of art and cinema.  It will be part video art course, part practical filmmaking, part joyride through experimental film history. It will take as its baseline assumption the notion that experimentation is crucial to overcoming encrusted social, aesthetic, intellectual, and ideological norms. Over the course of the quarter, students will view and discuss a range of key works from the history of experimental cinema. Just as importantly, they will build familiarity with the the myriad components of cinematic creation, from directing, editing, camera operation, lighting, sound design, After Effects to color grading. No prerequisite required.
