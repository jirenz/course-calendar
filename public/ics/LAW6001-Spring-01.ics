DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 335)  This course will explore issues involving professional responsibility. Topics will include the role of advocates, the adversary system, the conditions of practice, diversity, candor, and confidentiality, conflicts of interest, lawyer-client relationships, regulatory structures, access to justice, pro bono service, and legal education. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class participation and (1) short reflection essays on the readings and a short research paper or (2) a long paper. A maximum of 10 students will be permitted to write the long paper for R credit. After the term begins, 10 students can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. If more than 10 students apply to write a long paper for R credit, a lottery will be run to determine the 10 students accepted in section (02). This class is designated as fulfilling the Ethics requirement (and the R requirement with instructor consent). Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, and either long paper or short reflection essays on the readings and short research paper.
