DESCRIPTION:Have you ever Googled yourself? If so, what information about you rises to the top? A picture of you in your band uniform from your high school? A poem you wrote and published on your Tumblr? Maybe your scores from a 5K you ran last year? nnIt might seem like you don&iquest;t have much control over what you see about yourself in a Google search, but the fact is, you do. The more that you create your own content, the more that your self-created information will rise to the top. Through learning the theories, tools, and techniques behind digital image management, this class will help prepare you for curating your digital self. In so doing, we can get better connected with the individuals and/or organizations that interest us.  nnWe will practice several pragmatic techniques for building our own personal ePortfolio (i.e. a website). Through participating in hands-on activities, storytelling exercises, and in-class discussions, you will have the opportunity to enact what we&iquest;re learning and to experiment with different forms of expressing yourself online.
