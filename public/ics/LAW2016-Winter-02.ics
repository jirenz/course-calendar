DESCRIPTION:This seminar will explore how the law thinks about violence.  Across various legal domains---e.g., criminal law, criminal procedure, juvenile justice, immigration, domestic violence, family law, civil rights, free speech, firearms regulation---we will study when and to what extent the law marks off violence as a category of distinct concern, how violence is defined, and what ideas the law reflects about how violence operates.  Students may elect to write a substantial research paper or a series of short response papers.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Response Papers or Final Paper.
