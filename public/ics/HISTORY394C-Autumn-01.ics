DESCRIPTION:For four hundred years, the peoples of China and the West have engaged with each other. What happened when worlds and world-views came into contact? In this course, we will explore the experience of encounter and its cultural impact on two largely distinct, but never isolated societies. We will study the history of cross-cultural exchange between China and the West to see how each emerged through dialogue with the other and to understand the roots of our own interconnected world.
