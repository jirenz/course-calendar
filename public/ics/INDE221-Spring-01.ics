DESCRIPTION:First course in three-sequence Science of Medicine block. Focus is on structure, function, disease, and therapeutics of the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. The Science of Medicine block presents organ system-based histology, pathology, physiology, pharmacology, and infectious disease in a sequence of interdisciplinary courses. Each organ-specific integrated course includes a review of the anatomy and related histology, normal function of that organ system, how the organ system is affected by and responds to disease including infection, and how diseases of that organ system are treated (therapeutics).
