DESCRIPTION:Preference to sophomores. &iquest;The humor, the sadness, the EVERYTHING-ness and American-ness of these pictures!&iquest; wrote Jack Kerouac of photographer Robert Frank&iquest;s iconic collection, The Americans. This seminar takes Kerouac&iquest;s enthusiasm and applies it to ten American photographs, a new one each week. Examples span the medium&iquest;s history and were taken as art, science, commerce, journalism, or personal mementos. Close study of the photo of the week will address how it looks and why; its history, from initial responses to later reception; and its relationship to the larger American visual and cultural context. Also under discussion: What story does this set of pictures tell about Americanness?  What might another set of photos convey?
