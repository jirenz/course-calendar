DESCRIPTION:In this workshop we will traverse the landscape of world of Musical Theater. It will serve as an introduction for the beginning actor and singer, and expand the more experienced performer's range in this genre.  The world of Musical Theater is filled with stories of love, passion, joy, violence, heartbreak and rage. The class will include an introduction to vocal and movement skills for musical theater, beginning with exercises to build an ensemble and encourage a sense of play and relaxation in supportive environment. Our class must be a place where everyone feels safe. As ensemble members, we will be responsible for each other in this environment. nStudents will choose one solo song, and perform in a group number from this exciting discipline. The instructor will work with the actors on technique, utilization of action, specificity of language, personalization, and emotional truth.  A professional coach from the theater community will conduct vocal coaching. Physical warm-ups and choreography will be suited for both the dancer and non-dancer.nThe class will culminate in the last week with live performance for friends and family.nSTUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BRING THEIR OWN SUGGESTIONS.  (Isn't there a role you've always wanted to sing?)nRequired text:  Broadway Musicals Show by Show: Sixth Edition - Stanley Green; Paperback
