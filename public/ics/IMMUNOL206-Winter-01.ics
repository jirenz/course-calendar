DESCRIPTION:Introduction to computational tools for analyses of immunological data sets, including but not limited to single-cell data such as that from flow cytometry of CyTOF, as well as genomic anlayses.  Students become familiar with major web-based databases and analysis suites for immunological and genomic data; gain a working knowledge of the major software/algorithms for working with major data types, and be able to apply at least one computational tool in these areas to analyze a public data set.  Students taking the course for 2 units will complete a computational analysis project and present it to the class.
