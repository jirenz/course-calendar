DESCRIPTION:Intensive reading of Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot;  (the first canticle of his three canticle poem The Divine Comedy).  Main objective: to learn how to read the Inferno in detail and in depth, which entails both close textual analysis as well as a systematic reconstruction of the Christian doctrines that subtend the poem. The other main objective is to understand how Dante's civic and political identity as a Florentine, and especially his exile from Florence, determined his literary career and turned him into the author of the poem.  Special emphasis on Dante's moral world view and his representation of character. Taught in English.
