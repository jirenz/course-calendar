DESCRIPTION:This quarter's film series will showcase ten of the most remarkable films and filmmakers in the long and under-represented history of queer cinema. Starting with Ang Lee's groundbreaking Brokeback Mountain (2005), we will discuss the issues of queer space, surveillance, and gender performance. Moving from cowboys to schoolgirls and streetgirls to further examine our assumptions about performance, sexuality, and space, we will discuss Leontine Sagan's classic Girls in Uniform (1931) and Sean Baker's recent smash hit Tangerine (2015). Turning towards the historical representation of queer communities we will watch Jennie Livingston's documentary Paris is Burning (1990) and Luchino Visconti's The Damned (1969) to examine the ways that homosexuality has been positively and negatively represented as subversive and decadent. For a lighter note, we will watch Jaco van Dormael's thought-provoking The Brand New Testament (2015), which imagines a complete resetting of social norms, and C&eacute;line Sciamma's Tomboy (2011), both of which examine the sometimes comical oftentimes challenging experiences of queer youth. To examine how queer relationships break down national, linguistic, and cultural boundaries we will watch Wong Kar-Wai's Happy Together (1997) and Pedro Almod&oacute;var's All About My Mother (1999). Finally, to conclude our series, we will screen Barry Jenkins' recent award-winning film Moonlight (2016).nnDiscussion will focus on analyzing the relationships between gender and sexuality, love and friendship, body and performance and discussing issues of sexuality, race, and class as well as the different ways that film has represented homosexuality and transsexuality across cultures, schools of cinema, film technologies, and history.nnAll screenings are free and open to the public and audience members are encouraged to participate in the discussions following the films. Please note that grades for this course are entirely dependent on attendance of at least seven screenings. Missed screenings can be made-up by writing a short paper on the film, pre-arranged with the instructor. Please be aware that some films may include graphic or disturbing content: viewers are therefore advised to familiarize themselves with the films' content before viewing. May be repeated for credit. nnScreening schedule:nJan 10 Brokeback Mountain (2005) Ang LeenJan 17 Girls In Uniform (1931) Leontine SagannJan 24 Tangerine (2015) Sean Baker nJan 31 Paris Is Burning (1990) Jennie Livingston nFeb 7 The Damned (1969) Luchino Visconti nFeb 14 The Brand New Testament (2015) Jaco Van Dormael nFeb 21 Tomboy (2011) C&eacute;line Sciamma nFeb 28 Happy Together (1997) Wong Kar-Wai nMar 7 All About My Mother (1999) Pedro Almod&oacute;var nMar 14 Moonlight (2016) Barry Jenkins
