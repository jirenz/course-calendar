DESCRIPTION:Language and social identity are closely intertwined. Have you ever noticed that you change the way you speak to present a particular social identity? For example, have you ever switched between dialects or languages to show alignment with certain social groups or mark your 'in-group' status? Because language is flexible (and somewhat controllable), it can be used as a resource to create and index identity. However, given its flexible nature, criticizing someone's language often becomes a more socially acceptable way of attacking someone than something that seems like bald-faced racism/sexism/homophobia, etc.  In this course we'll explore this complex link between identity and language.nnThis course explores the way language and social identity are defined, discussed, and debated in America, and the assumptions this rhetoric presents about race, class, education and other social identities more broadly.  Together, we&iquest;ll consider: What's it like to grow up monolingual versus bilingual or multilingual? What role do our ethnicity and/or race play in how our language skills are perceived? What role do language attitudes and stereotypes play in influencing our daily lives? What role does the media play? How is language discussed in politics? Students will be able to work on a research project related to social identity and language on a topic of their choice.
