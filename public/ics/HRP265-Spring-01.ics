DESCRIPTION:Meta-analysis is a method to quantitatively combine information from multiple studies; this combination is also called &quot;research synthesis.&quot; Historically, it has been used to combine studies with a similar design, such as randomized controlled trials or observational studies examining similar interventions or exposures. However, evidence about a given relationship is often provided by many studies with different designs, or studies that can be &quot;fit together&quot; to create an evidence base. This can only be done with advanced meta-analytic methods. The course will cover advanced methods for research synthesis, including multivariate meta-analysis for multiple outcomes, generalized evidence synthesis of multiple study designs, and network meta-analysis for multiple interventions. These techniques are being increasingly used in evidence-based medicine, health technology assessments and policy making. Recommended preparation: HRP 206, and at least 2 quarters of biostatistics and one of epidemiology, including clinical research design. Familiarity with logistic and linear regression modeling required.
