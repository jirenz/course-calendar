DESCRIPTION:This course is a practicum in which students will use the R programming language to analyze datasets by application of classical statistical methods. No prior experience with R (or other programming languages) is required, but a familiarity with basic descriptive and inferential statistics is assumed. Class sessions will include some lecture content but will emphasize coding demonstrations by the instructor and hands-on coding by each student on their own computers. Students will practice using R with open-source and simulated datasets. The primary goal of the course is to equip students with a fundamental understanding of R's capabilities, experience using R with practice datasets, and the ability to extend their facility with R as their needs dictate.
