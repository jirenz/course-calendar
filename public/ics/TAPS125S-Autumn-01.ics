DESCRIPTION:This active workshop will provide the actor with skills for performing Shakespeare with clarity, joy and power. Actors work with scenes and monologues to develop ease with scansion, freedom of voice, and to expand their physical and imaginative range. nnWe will also become acquainted with some of the ways that Shakespeare and other classic texts are being re-invigorated at the hands of modern writers and adapters.  We will investigate the world of styles and approaches an actor may encounter in new takes on classic plays in our own time.nn(Priority to TAPS majors-minors. Previous acting class required, or instructor permission.)
