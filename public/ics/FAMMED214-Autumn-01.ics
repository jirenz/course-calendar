DESCRIPTION:Being a medical student is busy! Being a physician is busy! How better to squeeze in healthy exercise habits than over the lunch break? This class is appropriate for all levels of fitness: it will challenge even the most fit physiques but can be modified for beginners. The exercises focus on the core muscles (abs, back, shoulders, hips/glutes) and use resistance training &iquest; you will work hard but won&iquest;t be so sweaty that you can&iquest;t go back to your afternoon classes. No need to bring anything, just show up and be ready to have fun to motivating music in this group fitness session.
