DESCRIPTION:With the growing impact of science and technology on our society, the emphasis on communicating that science well has never been greater. But what is effective science communication? Is it ever ok to use jargon? Is it ok to say &quot;I&quot; in my research report? How do I communicate complex topics in simple, but accurate, ways?  In this course, we will explore the variety of formats that science communication can take--from technical research papers on particle physics to children's books about genetics. We will explore how different audiences shape the way science is communicated, and we will develop a set of best practices for effective science communication. Students will then apply these strategies in their own science communication projects. Prerequisite: first two levels of the writing requirement or equivalent transfer credit. For more information, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/explore/nsc. Required of students admitted into the Notation for Science Communication after January 2015.
