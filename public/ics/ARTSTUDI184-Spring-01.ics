DESCRIPTION:The aim of this course is to use the tools of art &iquest; particularly photography and video &iquest; as a means to actively engage with the natural world.  Students will be required to go beyond surface representations and dig deep with their work to uncover conceptual, ecological and historical meaning.  Whether the focus is on a plant, animal, mineral, or an ecological system, students will be encouraged to investigate and interact with their subjects.  Scientists who experiment in the field will be brought in to discuss their research and working processes. Collaborations are welcome.  We will examine the work by artists, from past to present, who address the environment in a critical way.  Students will work on creative projects with the goal to open new avenues of dialogue between culture and nature.
