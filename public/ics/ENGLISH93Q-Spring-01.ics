DESCRIPTION:From Whitman to Kerouac, Alec Soth to Georgia O&iquest;Keeffe, the lure of travel has inspired many American artists to pack up their bags and hit the open road. In this  course we will be exploring the art and literature of the great American road trip. We will be reading and writing in a variety of genres, workshopping our own personal projects, and considering a wide breadth of narrative approaches. Assignments will range from reading Cormac McCarthy&iquest;s novel, <i>The Road,</i> to listening to Bob Dylan&iquest;s album, &iquest;Highway 61 Revisited.&iquest; We will be looking at films like <i>Badlands</i> and <i>Thelma and Louise,&iquest;</i>acquainting ourselves with contemporary photographers, going on a number of campus-wide field trips, and finishing the quarter with an actual road trip down the California coast. Anyone with a sense of adventure is welcome!
