DESCRIPTION:As scientific knowledge and technology grow increasingly complex, the ability to explain science clearly and articulate science-based arguments to public audiences becomes more crucial, and more in demand. In this class, we will explore what makes written, spoken, and visual communication of science effective, compare the conventions of scholarly writing in the sciences to rhetorical strategies employed by popular science writers, and analyze problems with coverage of scientifically based issues in popular media and the promise and pitfalls of data visualization in conveying scientific information.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
