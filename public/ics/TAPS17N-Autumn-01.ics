DESCRIPTION:Acting for Activists is designed for students who are interested in combining acting with activism, performance with politics.  We will work with theatre that responds to specific political events and crisis such as hate crimes or war  through the performance of activist texts.  We will also explore works that challenge inequalities of income, race, gender and sexual orientation. By the end of the course students will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing and critiquing work within acting/activist contexts and develop new strategies for creating theatre in relation to issues they are passionate about.  Acting for Activists encourages students to think about what they want to say and helps them craft how they want to say it.
