DESCRIPTION:The &quot;Asian American Movement&quot; was born in the late 1960s inspired by other movements for social change and justice in the era.  Activism among Asians in America has a longer history and a continuity to today.  We will examine past, present, and future and consider issues of racial/ethnic identity, of inequality, and of injustice.  And we will explore avenues that sought remedy and progress.  Political, social, cultural, gender and sexuality, and international dimensions will be considered.
