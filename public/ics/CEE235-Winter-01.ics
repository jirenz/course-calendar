DESCRIPTION:Silicon Valley's rapid expansion has created explosive urban development in a fragile and under-prepared natural context.  Delicate coastal ecology and rapid urbanization (expanding technology headquarters, new residential housing, parking, services, etc.) are competing for space.  The same land also serves the regional functions of transport, open space, recreation, water supply, flood protection and wastewater treatment. Compounding the problems between these competing factors are global climate change instabilities increasing the certainty of catastrophic flooding, infrastructure collapse, and other urban resilience challenges. Students will be immersed in a process that allows them to understand and spatially identify these risks, develop a vocabulary and understanding of innovative tools to respond to them, and then work with expert practitioners to create unique design responses. Students will be provided with urban design frameworks (for planning, site development, and conservation) combined with advanced sustainable design concepts (such as resource co-optimization, and adaptable infrastructure platforms, and high performance urban ecology) by working with expert lecturers and in small groups.  Students will ultimately develop a series of visual and technical presentations to propose a final thesis for a local intervention that could be replicated in other coastal contexts globally. This course has been designed to develop student learning through a project-based format.  Students will be organized into design teams of 3 or 4 and will have the semester to collaborate with partners on an interdisciplinary proposal including policy and design recommendations.
