DESCRIPTION:In-class lectures and guest speakers who work in the Buy-Side to explore the synergies amongst the various players&iquest; roles, risk appetites, and investment time and return horizons. We aim to see the forest and the different species of trees growing in the forest known as the Buy-Side, so as to develop a perspective as financial engineers for how the ecosystem functions, what risks it digests, how it generates capital at what rate and amount for the Sell-Side, and how impacts in the real economy are reflected - or should be reflected - in the culture and risk models adopted by the Buy-Side participants.
