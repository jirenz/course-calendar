DESCRIPTION:This course examines the unique institutional, governance and transparency issues affecting corporate valuations in emerging markets.  Through lectures, case discussions and the students' real-time analysis of an emerging market firm, this condensed course is structured for students to gain a deeper understanding of the economic pressures behind the value creation, value destruction and valuation process in emerging economies. The course focuses on critically interpreting financial and non-financial information for purposes of assessing firm fundamentals and corporate governance risk in the presence of weak legal systems, strong political forces, limited investor protections, limited market development, strong macro-economic forces, opacity and resultant business arrangements.  The course is beneficial for entrepreneurs, consultants, investors and managers operating in or considering expansion to developing markets.
