DESCRIPTION:Stanford's unofficial motto, &quot;the wind of freedom blows,&quot; engraved in German on the university seal, invites us the ponder freedom in the context of education.  What is the relation between freedom and the &quot;liberal&quot; arts?  Does studying free your mind?  Does free will even exist?  If so, how does education help you develop its potential?  This course will look at various authors -- from antiquity through the 20th century -- who have thought about the blessings, burdens, and obligations of human freedom.  Beginning with Eve in the Garden of Eden, we will explore how exercising freedom in your personal choices and conduct not only determines your fate as an individual but carries with it a measure of responsibility for the world.  We will place special emphasis on the implications of such responsibility in our own time.
