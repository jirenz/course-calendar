DESCRIPTION:Students engage in professional photographic (studio) practices that prepare them to apply and extend the skills, methods and techniques they have learned in previous courses, including digital and analog shooting with digital print production. n nThese practices involve working collaboratively, taking on short-term projects, handling an increased media work flow, actively participating in regular critiques, and contributing to and showing work in a small final exhibition. Students refine their aesthetic, tap the interdisciplinary network of influences they have built, and work independently to become adept at presenting their ideas and building a portfolio to show the art they have produced to potential clients in a 'real world' professional context. n nAnyone interested in taking this class should apply with a project in mind that they aim to develop over the length of the course. Since these projects will require a considerable amount of independent work outside class time, students should submit a 1-to-2-page description outlining what they want to focus on and a portfolio featuring some images of work they have already created in that realm. Upon careful evaluation, students with the strongest proposals will be selected.n nThis course may be repeated for credit. Prerequisite: ARTSTUDI 275, ARTSTUDI 278, or equivalent.
