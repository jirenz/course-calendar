DESCRIPTION:(Formerly 321) This skill-based course examines the core requirements and strategies for drafting and prosecuting a patent application before the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (US PTO). The class brings in real inventors and US PTO patent examiners to give students a real-world experience of developing a patent, understanding patentability and building patent portfolios, and getting a patent application prosecuted through the patent office. Students will interact with the inventors and examiners to gain the experience of getting a patent issued -- through interactions with an inventor to develop an idea and draft a patent application, responding to rejections and office actions from the US PTO after filing the patent application, through interactions with examiners to interview the office action and getting the application issued. This course is open to people with technical or non-technical backgrounds -- all you require is an interest in patent law. A solid understanding of patent claims and internal mechanics (which this class focuses on) will be helpful experience and background for students interested in pursuing any patent litigation or transactional practice. Students are evaluated on participation, in-class and take-home exercises, and projects relating to the drafting and prosecution of a patent application.
