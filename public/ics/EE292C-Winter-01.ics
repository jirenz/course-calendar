DESCRIPTION:Fundamental aspects of CVD are initially considered, first focusing on processes occurring in the gas phase and then on those occurring on the surface.  Qualitative understanding is emphasized, with minimal use of equations.  Adding energy both thermally and by using a plasma is discussed; atomic-layer deposition is briefly considered.  Examples of CVD equipment are examined.  The second portion of the tutorial examines layers deposited by CVD.  The focus is on group IV semiconductors &iquest; especially epitaxial and heteroepitaxial deposition, in which the crystal structure of the depositing layer is related to that of the substrate.  Polycrystalline silicon and the IC interconnect system are then discussed.  Finally, the use of high-density plasmas for rapid gap filling is contrasted with alternative CVD dielectric deposition processes.
