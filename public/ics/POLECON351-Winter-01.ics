DESCRIPTION:This course will provide both theoretical and practical assistance to students who will be engaged in global business -- in terms of understanding and negotiating issues of custom, cultural ethos, and underlying religious traditions which are often unspoken but critical to business success.  Frameworks and modes of analysis will be presented that can be used universally, but then will be applied concretely, through case studies, to business contexts in China, Japan, India, the Middle East, Israel, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the United States.  Background information will be included on major religious traditions involved, like Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity.  The class will be discussion-based, drawing on students' own life experience as well as that of invited guests who are personally familiar with business practices in various parts of the world.
