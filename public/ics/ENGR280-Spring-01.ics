DESCRIPTION:Focus is on enhancing the innovation process with playfulness. The class will be project-based and team-centered. We will investigate the human &quot;state of play&quot; to reach an understanding of its principal attributes and how important it is to creative thinking. We will explore play behavior, its development, and its biological basis. We will then apply those principles through design thinking to promote innovation in the corporate world. Students will work with real-world partners on design projects with widespread application. This course requires an application. You can find the application here: dschool.stanford.edu/classes
