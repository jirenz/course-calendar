LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In this class we are going to read the two earliest plays in the Chinese southern dramatic tradition (nanxi) for what they can tell us of the foundation idea of a theater. We will examine Top Graduate Zhang Xie and The Lute, two tales of ambitious families and students, love, betrayal, strained family relations and even attempted murder. We will analyze their structure (music, act division and role organization), as well as the social and moral purpose of drama. Our discussion will focus on what these texts tell us about the purpose of theater, the values it attempts to promote and its social criticism. * Pre-requisite, one year of classical Chinese or equivalent.
