DESCRIPTION:This course offers an interdisciplinary, graduate-level survey of current and historical efforts to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States and around the world. Students will read primary legal documents---including statutes, regulations, and court cases---in order to evaluate the forces and institutions shaping American climate policy. Additional perspectives from climate science, economics, and political science will provide context as students analyze the evolution of climate law and policy regimes.  Elements used in grading:  Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either written assignments and an exam (section 01) or a final paper (section 02).  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Cross-listed with Environment and Resources (ENVRES 222).
