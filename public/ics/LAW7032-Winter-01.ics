DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 617)  This course will examine the history, theoretical frameworks, strategies used by, and political position of public interest law practice and attorneys in the United States. We will consider the role of lawyers and the legal system in advancing social change; different career paths of public interest lawyers; ethical issues related to working as a public interest lawyer; the personal impacts of this type of career choice; and tactics deployed by lawyers in differing settings, from issue-based non-profits to government agencies, and private public interest law firms or legal services groups. Readings will include law review articles, legal pleadings and case studies that allow analysis and exploration of the tensions and challenges that exist within the legal system for public interest practitioners.  Guest speakers will include leaders from the field.  Students will also be exposed to practical skills outside of litigation that social change lawyers should understand. Students will be asked to produce several short papers throughout the quarter. Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, written assignments.
