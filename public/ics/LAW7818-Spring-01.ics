DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 730)  This course covers the foundations of drafting contracts in a modern commercial setting, primarily through weekly hands-on writing exercises that illustrate business problems commonly found in today's technology transactions law practice.  Topics to be addressed will include basic contract anatomy, common clause ambiguities, structuring for readable &quot;flow&quot;, and drafting-for-negotiation techniques.  Final examination will involve crafting a full-length technology license agreement from a rough term sheet that appears to have been pecked out on some sort of mobile device.  No prior business law coursework, intellectual property background, or martial arts proficiency required.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments, Final Exam.
