LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Some people live their lives in a manner that would lead few to declare them good people. From Tony Soprano to Saddam Hussein to Bernie Madoff, we are all familiar with individuals who have made crime and violence a constant in their lives. There are far more people, though, who try generally to live good lives, but find themselves having acted or having failed to act in ways that are widely condemned as evil. In the first four of our five meetings, we will be looking (through some books, reports and films) at case studies of such circumstances, including (a) those in authority who have covered up evidence of sexual abuse; (b) prosecutors who have ignored evidence of a defendant's innocence, (c) lawyers who have turned blind eyes to client misconduct, and (d) soldiers who have committed acts they would have once found unimaginable. In our fifth session we will consider contrasting case studies of individuals who resisted great pressure and kept their moral compasses well-calibrated. Throughout our inquiry, we will reflect in particular on the power of institutions and authority in affecting ethical mores.  Winter Quarter.
