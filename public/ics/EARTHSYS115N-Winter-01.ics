DESCRIPTION:Desert environments make up a third of the land areas on Earth, ranging from the hottest to the coldest environments.  Aridity leads to the development of unique adaptations among the organisms that inhabit them.  Climate change and other processes of desertification as well as increasing human demand for habitable and cultivatable areas have resulting in increasing need to better understand these systems.  Namibia is a model system for studying these processes and includes the Sossuvlei (Sand Sea) World Heritable Site.  This seminar will prepare students for their overseas field experience in Namibia.  The seminar will provide an introduction to desert biogeography and culture, using Namibia as a case study.  During the seminar, students will each give two presentations on aspects of desert biogeography and ecology, specific organisms and their adaptations to arid environments, cultural adaptations of indigenous peoples and immigrants, ecological threats and conservation efforts, and/or national and international policy towards deserts. Additional assignments include a comprehensive dossier and a final exam.  Students will also carry out background research for the presentations they will be giving during the field seminar where access to the internet and to other scholarly resources will be limited. In addition, we will cover logistics, health and safety, cultural sensitivity, geography, and politics.  We will deal with post-field issues such as reverse culture shock, and ways in which participants can consolidate and build up their abroad experiences after they return to campus.
