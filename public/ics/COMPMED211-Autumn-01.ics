DESCRIPTION:Emphasis is on real-world experimental design and analysis in the life sciences, with particular focus on modern techniques that maximize power and minimize sample size, and avoiding common errors contributing to false discovery and the reproducibility crisis. This is a flipped-classroom. Class time is devoted to discussion of assigned reading (primarily Grafen &amp; Hailsm 2002 &quot;Modern statistics for the life sciences&quot;), critique of papers, working through example data sets, and developing analyses for the students' own research data. The objective is to provide MLAS students with a fundamental understanding of basic statistics, particularly as applied to the design and planning of animal-based research projects.  Enrollment is limited to MLAS students, unless student has course director consent.
