LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 516)  The Law and Humanities Workshop: History, Literature, and Philosophy is designed as a forum in which faculty and students from the Law School and from various humanities departments can discuss some of the best work now being done in law and humanities. Every other week, an invited speaker will present his or her current research for discussion. In the week prior to a given speaker's presentation, the class will meet as a group to discuss secondary literature relevant to understanding and critiquing the speaker's research. Students will then read the speaker's paper in advance of the following week's workshop presentation.  Students have two options. Those taking the course for 2 units are required to write a brief response to each speaker's paper. There will be a total of four speakers, and thus four papers. Guidance will be provided concerning how to frame these response papers, which will be due every two weeks - i.e., on the day before the speaker presents. Students taking the course for 3 units are required to write a research paper on a law and humanities topic that they choose (in consultation with the professors). Law students who complete this 3-unit track will receive an &quot;R&quot; credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Enrollment will be limited to 30 students -- 20 from SLS who will be selected by lottery and 10 from H&amp;S. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and writing assignments.  Cross-listed with the Department of History (HIST 308F).
