DESCRIPTION:The goal of this course &acirc; geared toward graduate students in marketing, psychology, and related disciplines &acirc; is to explore some of the issues and controversies that currently engage researchers in the domain of attitudes and persuasion. We will cover classic topics in this domain, but in each case we will emphasize new findings or recent directions.  Students who take this course will become familiar with research methods and major issues in attitudes research and will have a better understanding of how individuals form, use, change, and maintain their attitudes. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to critique existing research and formulate new research ideas.
