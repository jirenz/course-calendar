LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:What exactly is a diagnosis, and what is the history of that term? Why do Institutional Review Boards exist, and what atrocities in human medical experimentation occurred to prompt their creation? What is the role of narrative, social construction, and storytelling in medicine? This course will shed light on the ways physicians and scholars grapple with these and other important questions through a series of lectures from historians and philosophers of science, as well as bioethicists and scholars of narrative medicine. These perspectives on how scientific knowledge emerges and changes over time offer invaluable insights and frameworks for anyone aspiring to practice medicine or contribute to the collective body of scientific knowledge.
