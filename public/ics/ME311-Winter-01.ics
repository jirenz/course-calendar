DESCRIPTION:The objective of this course is to help students forge a new identity as a design leader. Most people find the transition from individual contributor to team leader challenging because it&iquest;s the first time that work needs to get done through others rather than doing things yourself. In a team leader role, you need to focus on getting things done and motivating, developing, and communicating with people. There is a balancing act between tasks and people and yet there is no simple rule to follow. Letting go of your identity as an individual contributor and helping you embrace a new one as a team leader is the first step into a design leadership role. This course will give you the language and concepts that will allow you to reflect on your own design leadership experience and growth while practicing it.
