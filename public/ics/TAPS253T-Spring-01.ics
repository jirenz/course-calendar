DESCRIPTION:Contemporary virtual reality extends a long-standing quest to create a fully immersive, multisensory environment, a quest that may go back to the earliest cave paintings and includes such projects as cathedrals, operas, panoramas, theme parks, video games, and multimedia &quot;happenings.&quot;  What is VR's relation to this long and varied history?  What are the ethics, aesthetics, promises, and perils of this new medium?  What is meant by &quot;immersion,&quot; &quot;interactivity,&quot; and &quot;presence,&quot; and how is VR changing those terms?  How might VR relate to contemporary immersive theater and installation art - as well as to the mediatization of society more generally?
