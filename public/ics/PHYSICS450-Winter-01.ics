LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:String theory provides a strong candidate for quantum gravity as well as contributing insights into many areas of physics. The class will start by evaluating the need for an extension of general relativity and quantum field theory, and assess the circumstances under which it becomes relevant (or `dangerously irrelevant' in the renormalization group sense). We will develop the basic tools for perturbative calculations and study their implications at short and long distances and in nontrivial spacetime geometries and topologies. The course will survey non-perturbative objects, dualities, compactification, and the structure of cosmological backgrounds of string theory, discussing their implications for early universe models and for the problem of upgrading holographic duality to cosmology.
