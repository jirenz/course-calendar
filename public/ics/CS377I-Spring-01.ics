DESCRIPTION:Complex problems require sophisticated approaches. In this project-based hands-on course, students explore the design of systems, information and interface for human use. The design of systems is about modeling the flow of interactions, data and context, exploring the possible inputs and outputs and crafting a design response that is useful, appropriate and robust. Through the design of user scenarios, information flows, maps and models, students will also gain an understanding of the differences and synergies between design and the organization of information, and the ability to evaluate and analyze the success of a system to achieve the intended goals. We will also examine the ethical consequences of design decisions and explore current issues arising from unintended consequences. Prerequisite: CS 147 or equivalent. 247 recommended, but not required. Offered on an experimental basis in Spring 2018.
