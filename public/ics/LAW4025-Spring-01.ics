DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 499)  With the increasing importance of technology to industry and the ease with which information can now be downloaded and shared, trade secret protection has become one of the most important issues in intellectual property today.  The law has to strike a balance between encouraging and protecting commercial investment in research, and preserving an individual's right to change employment or to compete directly against a former employer. In addition to examining the law and the theory behind it, we will emphasize the practical aspects of protecting information as a trade secret. We will discuss the challenges and issues involved in litigating trade secret cases, creating corporate programs to protect trade secrets, and drafting agreements.  We will feature several guest speakers and will highlight topics of current interest, such as &quot;inevitable disclosure,&quot; non-competition agreements, trade secrets and the Internet, and cybercrime.  The class should be of interest to students who expect to practice intellectual property law as well as to students who expect to be involved in corporate transactions and labor law.  Elements used in grading: Class participation and final exam.
