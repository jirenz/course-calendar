LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Cities and real estate generate lively public discussions, passionate community meetings, and political shouting matches. But how does a project actually get proposed and built? We explore the key actors and influencers in the urban built environment, ranging from urban planners to real estate developers to community advocates. This intensive d.school experience aims to deepen our insights about stakeholders, so that we gain a more empathetic understanding of how a city is built, and identify potential opportunities for improving the process of urban intervention and regeneration to be more responsive to citizens and responsible to society. Enrollment by application only. Find more info and apply at dschool.stanford.edu. (Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center). Course meets at the d.school in Studio 2.
