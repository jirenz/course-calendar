DESCRIPTION:Our emotions influence how we perceive the world, inform how we make critical life decisions, and connect us with other people.  Affective science, the scientific study of emotion, investigates how emotions shape our lives.  In this course, we explore how emotions arise as feelings we experience, behaviors we commit, and physiological reactions to our environments.  Across these levels of analysis, we will consider how emotions interact with our personalities, past experiences, future goals, stages of development, and socio-cultural surroundings.  We will learn how affective science has clarified the nature of emotion, how emotions evolved across diverse animal species, and how emotions impact our health and relationships with others.  You will leave this class with an improved, scientifically-informed understanding of your own and others emotions, and strategies for how to effectively use and manage your feelings in daily life.
