DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. Despite our fascination with extreme acts of violence, those who study the nature of illegality know the opposite to be true: Far from a problem of murder, crime is instead predominantly composed of everyday acts of offense that never garner police attention, such as tax evasion, the violation of environmental regulations, computer hacking, and recreational drug use. Critical criminologists term this kind of unprosecuted crime &quot;crime's dark figure&quot; because it flies below the radar of public awareness and judicial action. This course will take the divergence between cultural representations of crime and crime's &quot;dark figure&quot; as a point of departure. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
