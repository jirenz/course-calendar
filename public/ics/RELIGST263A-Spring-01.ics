DESCRIPTION:Imakita Ksen (1816-1892), the master of D. T. Suzuki's teacher, wrote the Zenkai Ichiran in 1862 for his feudal lord, a staunch supporter of Confucianism, in order to convey the attraction of Zen to him in Confucian language.  One way of reading this short work in Classical Chinese is as a product of religious conflict within the nineteenth century Japanese world, but the text also reflects the form that had been taken by a lengthy tradition of polemical Buddhist writing dating back over one and a half millennia in East Asia at the very point that Buddhists  were about to turn to resisting the inroads not of Confucianism but of Christianity.  This reading class will allow students familiar with original East Asian Buddhist materials to appreciate some related non-Buddhist sources.  But  it possible to translate into English a book that itself translated Buddhism into Confucian terms? Undergraduates register for 200-level for 5 units. Graduate students register for 300-level for 3-5 units.
