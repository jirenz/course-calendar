LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Write and Shoot: Narrative Filmmaking is a hybrid writing/production course that guides students through the process of completing a 2-3 minute narrative film. Students will write scripts for short fiction films, and then, by filming them, learn to apply the fundamentals of digital video production. Initial classwork will include visual writing exercises, DSLR cinematography instruction, script work, and basic fiction film production. Students will continue on in groups of three to develop, film, edit, and critique 2-3 minute narrative films based on a shared class theme or narrative premise. This course is truly INTENSIVE and requires a significant amount of work (including nights and weekends) outside of class and daily deadlines for submission of creative work.
