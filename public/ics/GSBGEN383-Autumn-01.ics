DESCRIPTION:This is a skills/toolbox class. The goal is to teach future business leaders how Washington actually works so you can interact more effectively with it and be a better informed citizen and voter. This course is about the practice of policymaking and politics, not the theory of either. It has three major components: (1) Elections, focused on the exciting and chaotic election cycle this fall; (2) Governing, focused on the mechanics of White House and Congressional policy decision-making, and (3) Practical Skills for interacting with Washington, DC.nnWe'll quickly cover everything you should have learned in civics class: how the electoral college works, the structure of Congress and the Executive Branch, how a bill becomes a law. Then we'll look at how it really works--what lobbyists do, how a President gets information and makes decisions, how and why it's so hard to change policy or enact a new law. We'll simulate a White House presidential decision-making process. We'll examine presidential and congressional election strategies. We'll discuss the strategy and tactics of trying to pass (or block) legislation.nnWe'll also look at political parties, get a better understanding of the makeup of the American polity and how it's changing.nnWe'll also discuss working in Washington--especially running for office, appointed positions. We'll look at what's involved in political fundraising and interacting with the DC press corps. We'll talk about how one might participate in the policy process from outside of DC. I hope to have a few guest speakers.
