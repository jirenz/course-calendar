DESCRIPTION:This course explores the close relationship between energy and environmental law. We will work through the major energy sectors and, for each, discuss key environmental law and policy issues that are influencing energy production and use.  Our focus will be on current issues.  We'll explore environmental issues that are traditionally associated with the energy sector, including air emissions, waste disposal and cleanup, and oil spills, while also covering new environmental issues emerging from the energy sector including climate change-related regulatory and business risk issues, energy infrastructure permitting issues, and environmental pressure points on the utility industry and on renewable energy and conventional energy projects, more generally.  Elements used in grading:  Exam; one written assignment; class participation.
