LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Analysis of the entertainment song (&quot;ci&quot;) in 11th and 12th centuries, known for its treatment of romantic love and the affections. How do male writers represent love as experienced by men and by women in entertainment songs? What happens when a woman writes in this form, dominated by male authors? How does the form change from a low-status entertainment genre, widely viewed as frivolous, into a high literary form that excited writers about its new expressive potential? Prerequisite: Advanced reading knowledge of Chinese.
