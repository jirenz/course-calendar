DESCRIPTION:As a discipline, rhetoric is not only very old but also very young. It was born in ancient Greece in fifth century of B.C. China also has a long history of rhetoric. Chinese Rhetorical thought can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.). Confucius put forward Xiu Ci(rhetoric) first.nnChinese Rhetoric is a course which I gave to international students at Peking University more than 20 years ago. The course offers basic knowledge and fundamental theory of Chinese rhetoric comparatively. It contains basic concept of rhetoric, rhetorical means and methods and their functions, style and register, rhetorical law and principles, methods and skills about discourse construction and discourse comprehension, and the brief history of Chinese rhetoric studies.nnThis course tries to reveal the characteristics of Chinese rhetoric and Chinese culture from the cross-cultural vision. For example, as for metaphors, occidental people often use roses to highlight the beauty of a lady. In China, different flowers have different meanings when they are used as metaphors, such as peony, peach blossom, lotus, and etc. I try to have the students to grasp rhetorical law practically and comparatively. This course aims to improve students competence in cross cultural communication.
