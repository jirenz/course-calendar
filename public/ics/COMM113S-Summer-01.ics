DESCRIPTION:This course will explore how self-representation, interface design, and media affordances affect both online and offline behavior. Readings and lectures will introduce students to theories in psychology, communication, and human-computer interaction. Students will learn about media affordances, trends in media consumption, and think about the societal implications of having mediated identities. The second half of the course will focus on how media consumption and self-representation, coupled with interface design, affect attitudes and offline behavior. Topics include deception, social interactions, activism, empathy, and prosocial behaviors within the context of social networks, gaming, augmented and virtual reality. The course will include a combination of written assignments, labs, a group project, and a tour of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab.
