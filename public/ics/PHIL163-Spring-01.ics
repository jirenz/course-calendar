LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Graduate students register for 263.)nThe influences of Hertz, Boltzmann, Mach and Planck on the development of Einstein's philosophical views regarding the scope and limits of physical theory. The distinction between &iquest;principle theories&iquest; and &iquest;constructive theories&iquest; from Poincar&eacute; and Lorentz, to Einstein. The impact of special and general relativity on logical empiricism. How Einstein&iquest;s views changed in response to two core challenges, the advent of quantum mechanics and his three-decades long failure to extend general relativity to a &quot;theory of the total field&quot;.  We conclude by considering the lasting impact of Einstein's philosophical views, and whether they can be assimilated to contemporary currents in philosophy of science.nnPREREQUISITES: No detailed knowledge of physics or mathematics is presumed.  Some background in philosophy, natural science or mathematics will be helpful.  Students will benefit from possession of a modicum of &iquest;mathematical maturity&iquest; (roughly equivalent to a familiarity with elementary single-variable calculus or the metatheory of first-order logic).
