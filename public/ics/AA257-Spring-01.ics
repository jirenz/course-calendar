DESCRIPTION:Hands-on design, analysis, and manufacturing of high-performance composite structures with multifunctional capabilities: structural health monitoring, state sensing and awareness, electrical energy storage, and built-in intelligence. Advanced composite structures will be fabricated and integrated with sensors, actuators, electronic circuits, and batteries to create multifunctional structures and devices for various applications: design of fly-by-feel UAVs and drones, self-powered electrical car frames, maintenance-free self-diagnostic structures, and intelligent structures for various engineering applications. The class will be divided into working teams (design, analysis, software, manufacturing, and testing) to design and build an intelligent structure or multifunctional device to be determined at the beginning of the course. Prerequisite: 256 or consent of instructor.
