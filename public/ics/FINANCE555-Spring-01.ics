DESCRIPTION:The Private Wealth Management and Personal Investing course will address issues that relate to the management of personal assets as opposed to institutional investing. It will cover the origins and growth of private wealth management as an industry, investment planning, risk management, inter-generational transfers of wealth, philanthropy and tax planning. Special emphasis is on issues surrounding the selection of a wealth manager, how managers may be evaluated, including potential conflicts of interest, and performance measurement. Classes will focus on case studies and various readings. Two instructors will lead the class, one from the GSB and one from the private wealth management industry. Most classes will be augmented by visits from professionals in the wealth management and private banking business. Active class participation and a group project are required.
