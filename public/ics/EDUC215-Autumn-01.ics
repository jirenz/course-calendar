This course will provide students an opportunity to link their academic learning to real world experience through in-class discussions, presentations, and reflective writing. It will allow the program director to monitor the quality of the experience and provide timely advice and support as needed for an optimal learning experience.nnThe course will meet several times each quarter, adjacent to LDT seminar (Fridays, 12-1). An internship agreement will be required at the beginning of the course signed by the faculty advisor), as well as a reflection paper at the end of the course.
