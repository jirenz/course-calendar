DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. What does a musical about founding fathers (<i>Hamilton</i>) have to say about current political upheaval? What do plastic surgery resorts have to say about identify politics? What does Steph Curry's game have to say about Hamlet - and about Prince - with alternative forms of masculinity? In this course we will examine contemporary mashups and remixers and you will build a research project to ground our work across the quarter creating interesting, meaningful, and dynamic presentations and papers. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
