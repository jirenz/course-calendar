LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:What is &quot;sexuality education&quot;, and what could it be? How do I tell a compelling story? In this class, students will learn about sexuality and storytelling from the inside out. We will explore various perspectives on sexuality that illuminate different aspects of our lives and then dive into our own stories to discover the richness and vibrancy of human sexuality. Due to the personal nature of the topic, we will emphasize safety, trust, and confidentiality throughout. The class offers the structure and guidance to 1) mine your life for stories, 2) craft the structure and shape of your stories, and 3) perform with presence, authenticity, and connection. Students will be selected from this class to tell their stories in Beyond Sex Ed: Consent &amp; Sexuality at Stanford during NSO 2018. Before enrolling, ensure that you will be on campus Sept 20-22, 2018 for rehearsal and performance. Email the TA, Eisa, with any questions, eqalshamma@stanford.edu.  Class will be held in KINGSCOTE Gardens First Floor Conference Room.
