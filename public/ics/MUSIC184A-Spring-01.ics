DESCRIPTION:This course is a practical workshop in early music vocal repertoire. The main focus of this course is to use original source material to explore editorial practice. Having prepared the score, students learn to perform the piece from an historically informed performance practice point of view. In addition to broadening the student's knowledge of vocal repertoire, the following skills are developed: text preparation, foreign language translation and diction; rehearsal for performance and/or recording. Prerequisite: vocal or instrumental instruction, as the class is open to singers or collaborative artists. May be repeated for credit a total of 4 times. Zero unit enrollment option available with instructor permission. See website: (http://music.stanford.edu) for policy and procedure.
