LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The field of &quot;law and economics&quot; provides important lessons for how legal institutions should be designed, but many of those lessons rely on the assumption that individuals behave in the way that maximizes their self-interest. Research from the fields of psychology and behavioral economics casts doubt on this assumption in numerous legal contexts. This seminar will explore a range of topics about human decision-making, focusing on how research in this area should inform the design of policy.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length. Elements used in grading: class participation, class attendance, reflection papers or research paper. Early drop deadline.
