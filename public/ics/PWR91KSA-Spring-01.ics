DESCRIPTION:What is story?  What is storytelling?  And why would storytelling be crucial for science communication?  In this class we will develop your Story IQ: we will learn how humans evolved to be the storytelling animal, how stories shape our lives, and why and how science communication needs storytelling in order to be relevant to public audiences.  We'll move from looking at story architecture, to critiquing story structures (and stories) in science communications, and then to creating compelling stories of our own that communicate and/or correct science research or discovery.
