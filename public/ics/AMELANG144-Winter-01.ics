DESCRIPTION:This course aims at familiarizing undergraduate/graduate students with some of the most significant classical and modern works of Persian literature, an aesthetic tradition over a millennium old.  It requires no prior knowledge of, or familiarity with the canon of Persian literature, as it works through lecture-discussions on the history of Persian literature coupled with close readings and analyses of the best modern translations available in English along with the Persian texts.  As such, students with knowledge of four quarters of Persian Language or more are encouraged; however, the requirement is to have one year of Persian Language class. The course will include some discussions of literary history, literary translation and cross-cultural interactions as well as questions of historical trends, literary genres and other areas of interest to comparative literary studies. Students will be encouraged to search and share relevant secondary sources, both online and in print. Students will also be encouraged to explore additional works of their choice and share their findings with other class members. Attendance is an integral part of the course and will play a crucial part in determining active participation. Take-home and midterm tests are designed to ensure that students keep up with the reading and are able to place the literary works in their proper aesthetic, social, and historical contexts.  A final term paper on a relevant topic agreed upon between students and the instructor in individual conferences should bring together the result of the lectures, discussions and various readings in a statement of some significance with a scope that will connect more than one work and one period of Persian literature.
