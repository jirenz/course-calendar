DESCRIPTION:Too many alums are doing what they've always been told they're good at, and are living with regret and a sense that they're just resigned to doing this thing for the rest of their lives. Capabilities displaced their values as the primary decision driver in their lives. Our ultimate goal is to restore a sense of agency and passion into the lives of current Stanford students by creating the space to explore and experiment with the greatest design project possible: YOUR LIFE. We will turn d.school tools and mindsets onto the topic of our lives -- not in theory, but in reality -- and will prototype changes to make your life and career more fulfilling and rewarding. We will actively empathize and experiment in your life and work, so if you don't want to do that kind of self-examination, this class will not be a good fit for you.
