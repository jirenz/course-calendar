DESCRIPTION:U.S. policies for science, technology, and innovation; political institutions that create and carry out these policies; government programs that support scientific research and the development and use of new technologies; political controversies surrounding some science and technologies and the regulation of research and technology; international aspects of science and technology; the roles of scientists, engineers, and physicians in creating and implementing policy; and opportunities to do policy work in government and other organizations. Assignments: analyzing the politics of particular executive and legislative proposals, assessing options for trying to reach specific policy objectives, and preparing mock memos and testimony. This course is designed primarily for graduate students in science, engineering, and medicine who want to learn more about science and technology policy and how it is made. Public Policy 353A is a &quot;gateway course&quot; - an introduction - both for students pursuing a joint degree or co-terminal degree in Public Policy and for other graduate students interested in S&amp;T policy or possible careers in the policy world. Junior and senior undergraduate students are also welcome to enroll.
