DESCRIPTION:A small group (8-10)  of medical students experientially exploring of the interconnections among human capacities such as thought, emotion, belief, attitudes, and physical health. Review and practice of specific skills (including mindfulness exercises, meditation, imagery, visualization, body awareness, autogenics, and biofeedback) to enhance self-awareness, self-expression, and stress management. Readings relevant to mind-body medicine made available. Anticipated benefits to class participants include discovering and mobilizing their capacity to participate in valuable and proven methods of self knowledge and stress reduction, while dealing with the frustrations and alienation that many students experience in medical school and beyond.
