DESCRIPTION:This seminar assesses the impact of education technologies on learners, teachers, and education systems. Through weekly case studies of ed tech ventures, students will experience and evaluate popular education technologies such as VR, personalized learning, makerspaces, and MOOCs. Additionally, students will develop a toolkit of concepts including critical pedagogy, constructivism, behaviorism, and social reconstructionism which they can use to assess education technologies and their personal contributions to the field. This course will focus largely on ventures in the U.S., but the frameworks developed will be applicable to equity and access issues in education throughout the world.
