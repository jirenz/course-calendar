Uses a wide variety of experiential methods, including workshops, case studies, simulations, and team projects, supported by guest speakers and readings. Sample topics include how to frame and re-frame problems, how to challenge assumptions, how to work on creative teams, how to generate and test ideas, and how to tell a compelling story to communicate your ideas. Students also take on a quarter-long, team-based challenge that allows them apply the tools they learn to a real-world problem. Limited enrollment. Admission by application.
