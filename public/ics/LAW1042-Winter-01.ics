DESCRIPTION:This is a practice-oriented business law seminar designed to provide students with an understanding of the legal, business, financial and practical issues that arise in advising venture capital-backed and emerging growth companies through the typical stages of their development and common transactions. The seminar will cover selected corporate, securities and tax issues in areas such as business entity formation, corporate organization and governance, venture capital financings, employee benefits, acquisitions and initial public offerings, with an emphasis on practical solutions and business realities. The goal of the seminar is to provide students with a window into the daily life of a typical Silicon Valley-style corporate attorney.  Students are required to complete a number of assignments, participate in a negotiation exercise, participate in class discussions and sit for an exam. There will be required readings for each session that include a range of materials.  Some sessions will include guest speakers. This course is taught by Mark Reinstra (JD '92), a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.  Mark represents emerging growth companies in substantially all facets of their corporate lives, from incorporation, financings, strategic transactions and, ultimately, liquidity events.  Elements used in grading:  Students will be evaluated on class participation/assignments, negotiation exercises and a final exam (In-School Essay - closed book).
