DESCRIPTION:This elective 1-unit course is offered to 2nd-year, 3rd-year, and 4th-year Medical students, Residents, and Fellows, and to 2nd-year MBA students who aspire to improve their ability to deal effectively with difficult interpersonal situations.  The course will be taught at Stanford Medical School by H. Irving Grousbeck, Consulting Professor of Management, Stanford Graduate School of Business, with assistance from Dr. Charles G. Prober, Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education.  Teaching techniques that have been successful in helping business school students improve their ability to manage difficult conversations will be used. The course, which will be case-based, will involve frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing in actual medical situations.  Physician-experts often will be present to participate as class guests.  Relevant principles of professionalism, leadership, and psychology underlie the course pedagogy. There will be seven classes held on Wednesdays beginning September 27th and concluding on November 15th (no class on October 25).  Each class will begin promptly at 12:30 and end at 2:05, without a break.  Due to the abbreviated nature of the class (7 sessions), students will be expected to attend all classes unless excused in advance. Class preparation will include reading of assigned cases; analysis of the cases and recommendations as to how to confront specific difficult conversations (consistent with assigned study questions); and reading of assigned background material.  While optional, it is suggested that students form regular study groups.  For GSB students, 50% of the final grade will depend on classroom performance; the remainder will be based on a final written assignment of no more than 6 pages. GSB students will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis.  The course will be ungraded for Medical School students, Residents and Fellows.  All students will be expected to complete the written assignment. Class size will be limited to 35 students per the following:  (1) a maximum of 15 MBA2 students and (2) a maximum of 20 2nd-year, 3rd-year and 4th-year Medical Students, Residents, and Fellows.
