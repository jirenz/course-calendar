DESCRIPTION:This course provides an in-depth introduction to the doctrine, practice and critiques of the Inter-American Human Rights System (&quot;IASHR&quot;). Students will examine the major instruments for human rights protections in the IASHR, the Inter-American Court and Commission's procedure and jurisprudence, as well as the obstacles and opportunities that civil society, victims, and advocates encounter when engaging the inter-American system.  The Course will consider issues of implementation, and the types of measures and forms of relief that can be sought from the Court and the Commission. The inter-American system has played a crucial role in opening spaces for debate on human rights protections in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing protections at the domestic level, and supporting civil society in its quest for accountability for massive human rights violations.  The system has also played a role in civil society efforts to bring the human rights debate home, including in the United States.  Students will have an opportunity to cast a comparative look at the inter-American and the European Human Rights systems and to consider the comparative advantages, disadvantages and complementary potential of regional human rights systems and universal international human rights and criminal justice bodies.  Cross Registration: This Course is open to graduate students across the university, with permission of the instructor.  Preference for cross-registration by non-Law School students will be given to students enrolled in the Master of Arts program in Latin American Studies.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Short Written Assignments, Final Paper.
