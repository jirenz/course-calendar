DESCRIPTION:Artificial intelligence is poised to make radical changes in healthcare, transforming areas such as diagnosis, genomics, surgical robotics, and drug discovery. In the coming years, artificial intelligence has the potential to lower healthcare costs, identify more effective treatments, and facilitate prevention and early detection of diseases. This class is a seminar series featuring prominent researchers, physicians, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists, all sharing their thoughts on the future of healthcare. We highly encourage students of all backgrounds to enroll (no AI/healthcare background necessary). Speakers and more at shift.stanford.edu/healthai.
