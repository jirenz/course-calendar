LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:What if you could do brain surgery completely noninvasively? This is possible now. There are many ways to focus energy into the body, and these can be used for surgery. We will explore methods for minimally invasive treatments of various conditions such as cancer, atrial fibrillation, and movement disorders. We will start with radiation therapy and its application to cancer. We will discuss the application of thermal energy to heat and ablate tissue. We'll discuss delivery systems including ultrasound, laser, and radiofrequency ablation systems, as well as monitoring imaging methods MRI, CT and ultrasound. Lastly, we will discuss neuromodulation and neurostimulation with deep brain simulators, transcranial magnetic stimulation, direct current stimulation, and ultrasound. We will touch on the biology of these treatments and their clinical application, but the emphasis is on the physics and engineering. High school Physics required.
