DESCRIPTION:Medicine, like theater, is both a skill set and an art form.  The practice of medicine demands exceptional communicative, cognitive, and interpersonal skills in order to respond to unpredictable situations while interacting with a wide variety of individuals.  Improvisational theater skills have a surprising and substantial overlap with those required of clinicians.  Improv is a genre of performance art grounded in principles of spontaneity, adaptability, collaboration, and skilled listening.  In this course, the principles and training techniques of improvisational theater are used to highlight and improve awareness, communication, and teamwork in the field of medicine.  Limited enrollment/class size will be 10; however should add'l students want to enroll pls contact Dr. Drew Nevins at anevins@stanford.edu.
