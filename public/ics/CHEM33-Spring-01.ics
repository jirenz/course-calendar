DESCRIPTION:Introduction to organic chemistry. Learn to relate three dimensional structure of organic molecules to their chemical and physical properties. Introduced to a variety of functional groups that exhibit patterns of reactivity and learn how to predict products of a reaction in the context of thermodynamics and kinetics. Two hour weekly lab section accompanies the course to introduce the techniques of separation and identification of organic compounds. Prerequisite: 31A,B, or 31X, or AP Chemistry score of 5.
