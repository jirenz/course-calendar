DESCRIPTION:While the tools of Digital Archaeology frequently change, using digital tools has been part of the discipline for decades.  These tools and approaches provide new forms of research, visualization, and outreach to archaeological investigations.  This course is designed to introduce students of archaeology to the digital research methods useful to the discipline, and provide them with hands-on experience in three types of digital method: digital mapping, visualization, and 3D modeling. The goal of the course is for students to learn about the state of digital archaeology, to become familiar with common methods, and become aware of the resources available for research.
