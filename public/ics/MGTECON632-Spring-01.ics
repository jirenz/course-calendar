DESCRIPTION:This seminar-style course studies a selection of micro-economic models in dynamic settings, and explores the use of continuous-time methods to solve them. Topics to be covered include experimentation games, social learning, principal-agent problems, career concerns/market-agent models, security design and strategic trading. For every topic discussed, the class introduces gradually the set of relevant mathematical tools: dynamic programming and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, Pontryagin's maximum principle, Euler-Lagrange equations, Brownian and Poisson processes, Bayesian inference and linear filtering, change of measure, martingale representation, Malliavin derivatives, stochastic maximum principle, expansions of filtrations. nThe course emphasizes high-level intuition rather than mathematical rigor. It is targeted at those who seek to become familiar with the literature on continuous-time dynamics and want to understand the functioning of these models, either by general interest or to apply these techniques. n
