DESCRIPTION:Designed for adventurous dancers, choreographers and student dance team leaders across Stanford campus. Students will explore a multiplicity of dance styles presented both by peer choreographers, as well as professionals in the field, to create a community of dancers who want to experiment and innovate within their form. The emphasis of the class is on individual growth as a dancer and dance maker through exposure to new and unfamiliar styles. Student dance team leaders and dancers with a strong interest in both choreography and learning different forms are highly encouraged to attend. Interested participants encouraged but not required to contact instructor, Aleta Hayes: ahayes1@stanford.edu. Course will consist of weekly choreography master classes taught by peers, composition intensives facilitated by the instructor, and guest professional master classes, not represented by the class participants.
