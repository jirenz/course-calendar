DESCRIPTION:The acting career of Burt Lancaster extended from 1946 to 1991. He began as a contract player within the Hollywood studio system, but, like many stars of the time, he founded his own production company in the 1950s. A tremendously physical actor, he entered film history as a brooding (if hunky) presence in film noir before becoming an exuberant swashbuckler in westerns and adventure films and, still later, a thoughtful, magisterial figure in works by a number of European auteurs.nnnThis course will have a dual grounding. Lancaster will be considered as a case study in film acting/performance. Acting is a fundament of narrative cinema and an undeniable source of cinematic pleasure, yet it represents a blind spot in film studies. The class will propose that the work Lancaster produced demonstrates coherence, consistency, and performative richness worthy of close examination. The class will also posit Burt Lancaster as an iconic screen figure whose long and manifold career may also be approached through a variety of other methodological frameworks, including genre (film noir, western, war film, spy thriller, etc.), national cinemas (American, Italian, French, co-productions), and authorship.nnnEach class will be divided between critical engagement with assigned readings, close analysis of Lancaster's performances, and careful attention to the stylistic and formal properties of the chosen films. The screening list will be supplemented with ample clips from additional films.
