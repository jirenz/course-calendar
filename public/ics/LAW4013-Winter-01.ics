DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 775)  This course will explore the roots of privacy law, its evolution in the 20th century in the face of ever changing technology, and the challenges of individual control over or government regulation of information in the modern era where institutions and individuals need and reveal information constantly, but also seek basic dignity and safety from harm. Privacy law is comprised of torts, contracts, constitutional law, statutory law, international law, soft law norms, and affected by emerging technologies. We will discuss all of these things, as well as incorporate developments in the news, from the perspective of the various privacy stakeholders--consumers, regulators and business.
