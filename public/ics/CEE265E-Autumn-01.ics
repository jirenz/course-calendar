DESCRIPTION:Students are introduced to basic aspects of climate change in the context of sea level rise and the intensity and frequency of extreme-weather events. Climate change adaptations are adjustments in behaviors, plans and projects to reduce society's vulnerability to climate change impacts. Major adaptation approaches relevant to civil and environmental engineers are reviewed. Adaptation measures considered include structural and ecologically-based measures for dealing with sea level rise and storm surges, as well as planned migration and managed retreat (i.e., deliberately altering flood defenses to allow flooding of presently protected areas). Strategies for adaptation to changes in extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, are also considered; examples include disaster response management systems and weather insurance. Illustrations of innovative adaptation measures taken by cities are featured as are techniques associated with climate-smart agriculture. Common barriers to climate change adaptation are also reviewed. Limited enrollment. Admission preference given to students in CEE graduate programs for Environmental Engineering, EFMH and EES followed by seniors doing the coastal focus area within the CEE Department's Environmental Systems Engineering major.
