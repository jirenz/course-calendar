DESCRIPTION:This course provides an introduction to the human-centered and technical workings behind interactive devices ranging from cell phones and video controllers to household appliances and smart cars. This is a hands-on, lab-based course; there will be no midterm or final. Course topics include electronics prototyping, interface prototyping, sensors and actuators, microcontroller development, physical prototyping and user testing. For the final project, students will build a working MP3 player prototype of their own design, using embedded microcontrollers, digital audio decoders, component sensors and other electronic hardware. Prior experience in programming, such as CS106A (or equivalent) or electronics, such as ENG40A (or equivalent) preferred. Students should attend the first class.
