DESCRIPTION:How can we ensure that measures taken to mitigate global climate change don't create larger social and environmental problems?  What metrics should be used to compare potential climate solutions beyond cost and technical feasibility, and how should these metrics be weighed against each other?  How can modeling efforts and stakeholder engagement be best integrated into climate decision making?  What information are we still missing to make fully informed decisions between technologies and policies?  Exploration of these questions, alongside other issues related to potential negative externalities of emerging climate solutions.  Evaluation of energy, land use, and geoengineering approaches in an integrated context, culminating in a climate stabilization group project.
