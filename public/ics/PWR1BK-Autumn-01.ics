DESCRIPTION:In this course, we will focus on the rhetoric of food in order to explore how our relationship to what we eat is reflected in writing about ourselves, our society, and our world. Essays, recipes, blog posts, and newspaper articles are some of the genres we will examine in order to explore how issues of identity, community, ethics, and wellness can be expressed in food writing. How does what we choose to eat reflect on how we see ourselves and the world around us? What responsibilities do we have, if any, as consumers of food in one of the world's richest nations?

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
