DESCRIPTION:A representation performs the task of converting an observation in the real world (e.g. an image, a recorded speech signal, a word in a sentence) into a mathematical form (e.g. a vector). This mathematical form is then used by subsequent steps (e.g. a classifier) to produce the outcome, such as classifying an image or recognizing a spoken word. Forming the proper representation for a task is an essential problem in modern AI. In this course, we focus on 1) establishing why representations matter, 2) classical and moderns methods of forming representations in Computer Vision, 3) methods of analyzing and probing representations, 4) portraying the future landscape of representations with generic and comprehensive AI/vision systems over the horizon, and finally 5) going beyond computer vision by talking about non-visual representations, such as the ones used in NLP or neuroscience. The course will heavily feature systems based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks. We will have several teaching lectures, a number of prominent external guest speakers, as well as presentations by the students on recent papers and their projects. nnRequired Prerequisites: CS131A, CS231A, CS231B, or CS231N. If you do not have the required prerequisites, please contact a member of the course staff before enrolling in this course.
