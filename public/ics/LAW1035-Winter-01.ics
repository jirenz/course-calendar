DESCRIPTION:This course is a comprehensive introduction to the law and practice of mergers, acquisitions and other complex transactions.  It will cover key and emerging issues in transactional legal practice, including in mergers, tender offers, carve-outs and asset sales, negotiated and unsolicited acquisitions, buyouts, conflict transactions, spin-offs/split-offs and deal activism. In addition to the relevant laws, regulations and fiduciary standards, the course will cover key aspects of the deal-making process, including mechanisms for protecting a preferred transaction and increasing deal certainty, takeover preparedness and responding to hostile offers, as well as structuring alternatives.  The course will include practical exercises on M&amp;A topics and guest speakers who have encountered some of the issues discussed.  Prerequisite:  Corporations, except on petition to the instructors based on prior coursework or special experience.  The course is intended both for students anticipating a career in transactional legal practice as well as for students seeking to develop a general understanding of issues in M&amp;A transactions. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.  Casebook:  We will be using a casebook:  Mergers and Acquisitions Law, Theory, and Practice by Claire Hill, Brian JM Quinn and Steven Davidoff Solomon (West Academic Publishing 2016).
