DESCRIPTION:Introduction to Theatrical Design is aimed at students interested in exploring the fundamentals of design for the stage.  Students are introduced to the practical and theoretical basics of design and are challenged to answer the question: What makes good design?  Students should expect to try their hand at communicating their ideas visually through research, drawing, sketching and model making.  Readings, field trips, guest lecturers and class discussion will complement these projects. This course is intended as a gateway to more specialized courses in set, costume and lighting design and is also an excellent primer for actors, directors and scholars who wish to know more about design. Collaboration will be emphasized. No prior experience in these areas is necessary.
