DESCRIPTION:This course introduces students to various intersections of social good and technology through a weekly discussion and speaker series. Students will be given a space to exchange ideas and experiences regarding a certain social issue. Invited speakers come from industry, academia, and non-profit organizations. They will share their career paths, what drove them to these fields, and advice for students. The topics examined will span a broad variety of social issues -- from race and class to education and sustainability -- and help students better understand how to kick off their journey in using computer science for social good.
