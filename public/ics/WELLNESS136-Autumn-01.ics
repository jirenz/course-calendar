DESCRIPTION:Investigate the power of meditation for training the mind in focusing attention and generating insight. Going beyond meditation as a tool for simply reducing stress, this course grounds the theory and practice of meditation in a deeper intention for realizing and abiding in the nature of awareness from a contemplative point of view, thus uncovering a sense of innate mental contentment and well-being. Though arising from the Buddhist tradition, all meditations are presented in a secular and empirical manner. This course is appropriate for beginners who wish to start a meditation practice and for intermediate practitioners who wish to deepen their practice. A five-hour weekend retreat day is a required part of this class (see notes section for details).
