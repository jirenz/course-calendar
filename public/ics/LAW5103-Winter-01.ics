DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 259)  The State-Building and Rule of Law Seminar is centrally concerned with bridging theory and practice. The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, and seminar discussions -- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process. Essentially, in a given context, what is the relationship of law to political, social, and economic change?  This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary.  Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper (for R credit) or an in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research.  CONSENT APPLICATION: The seminar is open by consent to up to twelve (12) JD, SPILS, and LLM students, and graduate students from other departments within Stanford University.  To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
