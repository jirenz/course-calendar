DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 427) Local governments exert tremendous influence over socioeconomics, race relations, environmental health, political power, and housing and real estate. This public law course will investigate the law of these governments (including cities, counties, and special districts) from four vantage points: (1) local governments within the federalist system, including the balance of power between local, state, and federal governments; (2) horizontal questions of power, including hierarchy and specialization among local governments; interlocal cooperation and competition; and the creation, expansion, and dissolution of local entities; (3) innovative uses and delegations of local authority to achieve state or local public policy goals; and (4) the nature of local democracy and local finance, including citizen influence of local lawmaking through initiatives and referenda, alternative voting schemes, and responses to fiscal distress. Discussions and in-class projects in the course will be situated in locations ranging from rural towns to major metropolises across the country. This class is limited to 30 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (25 students will be selected by lottery) and up to five non-law students by consent of instructor.  Elements used in grading: Class participation; in-class presentation, and one-day take home exam.
