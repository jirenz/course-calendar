DESCRIPTION:This course will focus on releasing a voice that effectively reaches the listener and is responsive to the actor&iquest;s thoughts and feelings.  Through work on breath awareness, alignment, resonance, and muscularity, students will learn to identify habits that help or hinder performance.  Students will practice exercises to develop vocal strength, clarity, ease, and expressiveness while exploring the vocal demands of various texts and performing environments.  Course will culminate in a presentation of classical and contemporary monologues.  This course is a good preparation for auditions, rehearsal, and performance, and is appropriate for all levels.  Priority space reserved for TAPS majors and minors.
