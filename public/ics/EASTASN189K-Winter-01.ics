DESCRIPTION:With strong nationalistic leadership in the US, China, Russia and Japan, and the ongoing North Korea problems, Korea (i.e. South Korea) faces daunting challenges of its foreign and security policies.  As changing circumstances continue to shape Korea's relations with its major neighboring countries as well as with the United States, this course will examine pragmatic and practical issues to understand the complexities and challenges in establishing sustainable peace and stability on the Korean peninsula as well as in Northeast Asia.  The topics discussed in the class will include the North Korean nuclear threat, China-North Korea relations, territorial and historical issues, and the reunification process.
