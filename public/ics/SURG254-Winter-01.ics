DESCRIPTION:For preclinical students; provides a background in and integrates knowledge of surgical anatomy and therapy. Surgical or operative anatomy differs from gross anatomy in that the area exposed during surgery may be limited, the dissection may require exposing other seemingly unrelated anatomic structures with unique landmarks, and the procedure may require unusual technical facility. Provides  an opportunity for students to understand the goals of representative surgical procedures (translating pathophysiology to surgical decision making to actual incision). Students learn surgical skills and perform the dissection of a number of commonly performed operations in the bio-skills laboratory. Emphasizes hands-on participation in surgical procedures in the laboratory and is taught by attending physicians in general, cardiothoracic, vascular, plastic, head and neck, urologic, and orthopedic surgery.
