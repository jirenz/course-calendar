DESCRIPTION:The goal of this course is to introduce bioengineering students to medical technology as it is used in current clinical practice, in the modern tertiary care, subspecialty hospital.  Half of the course will be devoted to labs, in which small groups of students participate in hands-on experiences using advanced clinical technology in areas such as medical imaging, robotic surgery, and minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment. The second half of the course brings pairs of students and clinical faculty mentors together for a more in-depth, focused exposure to clinical care in one specific area. Final grades will be based on attendance, and presentations made by each pair of student to the class about their mentoring experience.
