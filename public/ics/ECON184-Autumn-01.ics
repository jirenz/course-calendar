DESCRIPTION:This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of institutional investment management including asset allocation and manager selection across public and private equity, absolute return, real assets, and fixed income.  The course is co-taught by the CIO of Stanford's endowment and takes the perspective of an institution with a long-term investment horizon like Stanford.  We introduce and apply a framework for assessing investment strategies and investment firms.  Students put theory into practice by meeting with leading investors from various asset classes.
