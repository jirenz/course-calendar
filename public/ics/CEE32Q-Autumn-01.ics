DESCRIPTION:This seminar argues that architeccts are ultimately &quot;placemakers,&quot; and questions what that means in the contemporary world. Part I investigates the meaning of the word &quot;place.&quot; Additional background for understanding contemporary place making will include a critique of the history of modern place-making through an examination of modern form. Part II examines two traditional notions of place by scale: from &quot;home&quot; to &quot;the city.&quot; What elements give these conceptions of space a sense of place? To answer this question, themes such as memory, mapping, and boundary, among others, will be investigated. part III presents challenges to the traditional notions of place discussed in Part II. Topics addressed include: What does it mean to be &quot;out of place&quot;? What sense of place does a nomad have, and how is this represented? What are the &quot;non-places&quot; and how can architects design for these spaces? Part IV addresses the need to re-conceptualize contemporary space. The role of digital and cyber technologies, the construction of locality in a global world, and the in-between places that result from a world in flux are topics discussed in this section of the seminar.  nLearning goals: Specific goals include clsoe reading of texts, understanding of philosophical thinking and writing, argument under uncertainty, and developed concepts of place, space and architecture.
