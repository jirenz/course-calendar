DESCRIPTION:Most people agree that democracy is a good thing, but do we agree on what democracy is?  This course will examine the concept of democracy in political philosophy.  We will address the following questions: What reason(s), if any, do we have for valuing democracy?  What does it mean to treat people as political equals?  When does a group of individuals constitute &quot;a people,&quot; and how can a people make genuinely collective decisions?  Can democracy really be compatible with social inequality?  With an entrenched constitution?  With representation?
