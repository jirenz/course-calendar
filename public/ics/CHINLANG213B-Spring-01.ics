DESCRIPTION:Continuation of CHINLANG  212B.  Third quarter of Fourth Year Chinese for bilingual students. Discussions are based on short stories, essays and newspaper articles, along with related media materials. Emphasis is on social and cultural issues in contemporary China. Students will learn speed-reading techniques and explore more subtle distinctions in Chinese language use, such as formal vs. informal styles and word choice, toward developing a more sophisticated understanding and command of the language. Having completed one year of study at this level, students will acquire sufficient skills in reading, writing, and speaking on various topics of personal, or public, interests more effectively and accurately. Prerequisite: CHINLANG 212B.
