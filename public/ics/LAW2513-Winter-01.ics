DESCRIPTION:While climate change is often considered an 'environmental problem', the risks and opportunities embedded in a changing climate go well beyond the frame of the natural environment. This course will reframe climate as a macroeconomic challenge, one in which multilateral politics, global investment and physical and institutional infrastructure must be understood and reconsidered. Based on scholarly analysis and guest speakers, this interdisciplinary course will cover the past, present and future pillars of climate politics and finance. Starting with the policy framework established by past global climate negotiations, the bulk of the course will investigate current innovations at the intersection of finance and policy, including risk management and disclosure, blended finance, distributed solutions, and resilience measures. The final sessions will consider the future, taking a look at how future leaders might solve the greatest challenge of our time.  Elements used in grading:  Students may take the course for 2 units (section 1) or 3 units (section 2).  Section 1 and 2 students will both receive grades for attendance, in class participation and guest-speaker questions. Section 1 students will also complete a group presentation on the design of a financial, legal or policy intervention with the potential to reduce emissions on a large scale. Section 2 students will be required to write a research paper meeting the Law School's R paper requirements.  This class is limited to 25 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 students will be selected by lottery) and 10 non-law students by consent of instructor. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.
