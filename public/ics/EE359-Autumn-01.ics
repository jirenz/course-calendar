DESCRIPTION:This course will cover advanced topics in wireless communications as well as current wireless system design. Topics include: an overview of current and future wireless systems; wireless channel models including path loss, shadowing, and statistical multipath channel models; fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels; digital modulation and its performance in fading and under intersymbol interference; techniques to combat fading including adaptive modulation and diversity; multiple antenna (MIMO) techniques to increase capacity and diversity, intersymbol interference including equalization, multicarrier modulation (OFDM), and spread spectrum; and multiuser system design, including multiple access techniques. Course is 3 units but can be taken for 4 units with an optional term project. Prerequisite: 279 or instructor consent.
