LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This course is designed for preclinical medical students interested in acquiring the technical skills and clinical orientation necessary to learn and participate in the surgical environment. Scrub training starts the course to facilitate the learning of sterile technique required prior to participation in the operating room, and students will learn basic surgical techniques (including basic knot tying, suturing, hand-sewn bowel anastomoses, and laparoscopic skills) to enhance their operating room experiences.  The class requires one mandatory operative shadowing experience with an attending surgeon outside of normal class hours. The course will introduce students to the field of surgery both in this technical sense, as well as in regards to life as a surgeon, as opportunities for one-on-one surgical faculty membership will be provided. Preference is given to second year students.
