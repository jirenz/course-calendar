DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 519) This course will help students to develop the professional management skills that are essential for a successful legal career. The course will focus on team dynamics and leadership; influence and managing up; effectively communicating with clients, colleagues, other parties and tribunals; and managing expectations and unexpected adversity.  For the final paper, students will have the option to write a reflection paper on one of the topics covered in class, or create a personal plan outlining the substantive knowledge, professional skills, and business focus the student needs to build a fulfilling law practice. Assignments and simulations will demonstrate and model various skills and instructors will provide real-time feedback to students on class exercises. The course is not limited to any particular type of practice (size or substantive area). Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance, course exercises and written assignments.
