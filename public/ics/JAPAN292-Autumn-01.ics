DESCRIPTION:Are there reasons why certain words, phrases, sentences and prosody are chosen by language speakers and writers in specific contexts?  What linguistic and extra-linguistic elements give the hearers and readers the impression that certain utterances and passages are friendly, accusatory, officious, humorous, personal, formal, colloquial, etc.?  This seminar provides an introduction to different theoretical and analytical approaches to studying language use in context (e.g. pragmatics, sociolinguistics, usage-based grammar, conversational analysis, critical discourse analysis) and an opportunity to critically analyze text and talk.  Using the analytical tools acquired through readings and discussions, students will be able to analyze Japanese materials of their selection.  The course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with interests either (or both) in Japanese linguistics and literature.
