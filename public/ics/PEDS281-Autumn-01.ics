DESCRIPTION:The Pals Program is a volunteer activity serving Lucile Packard Children's Hospital chronically ill patients and their siblings.  Modeled after the Big Brother/Big Sister Program, Pals matches first- and second-year medical students with pediatric patients or their siblings. The patients and/or their siblings enjoy the support and companionship of their Pals, and the medical students learn firsthand about the emotional and social aspects of chronic illness during childhood. Pals meet regularly throughout the year to participate in fun activities such as movies, ball games, museums, and picnics.  The activities and personal relationships are overseen by the LPCH Pals social worker. Bimonthly class meetings introduce the students to pediatric chronic diseases such as leukemia, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. The class brings in physicians to give the medical perspective as well as patients and families to get their perspective.  Prerequisite: approval of the LPCH social worker for Pals.
