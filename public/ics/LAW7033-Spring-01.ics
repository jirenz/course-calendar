DESCRIPTION:This course explores theoretical, historical, and legal policy questions at the intersection of race, group identity, and national security. Recent political events have thrust the relationship between race, religion, nationality, immigration status, and national security into the limelight, although the questions themselves are not new. How do national security threats affect the formation of racial identity within the United States, and how does race affect our understanding of national security? How should we conceptualize exclusion or discrimination based on nationality, religion, or ideology, as compared to race per se? What is the proper role of courts in addressing challenges to national security policy affecting minority communities? This seminar aspires to understand contemporary policy questions in light of a broader theoretical, historical, and legal context. Class attendance and robust participation in discussion is required.  There are two options for assignments in this course.  You can either write 5 response papers throughout the course, or a single 18-20 page research paper related broadly to the themes of the course (for R credit).  Those who choose the research paper option will be expected to discuss and submit an outline of their research paper while the course is in session and to submit the final paper in accordance with standard law school requirements. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Response Papers or Research Paper.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
