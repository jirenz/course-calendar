DESCRIPTION:This discussion group will look at how ethical choices are shaped by organizational and group cultures. We'll read about some famous psychological experiments such as the Milgram and Zimbardo experiments; and some studies of decisions made in corporate organizations, government bureaucracies, and a battalion of ordinary middle-class Germans tasked with hunting down Jews; and talk about what insights from this work may be relevant to lawyers' ethics and working lives.  Begin in Winter Quarter and run through Spring Quarter.  Meeting Time:  Wednesdays, 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.  Meeting Dates:  TBD.
