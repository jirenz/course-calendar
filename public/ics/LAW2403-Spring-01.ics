DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 283)  This course considers the role of the federal courts in the federal system. It is both an advanced course in constitutional law (including the separation of powers and federalism) and a course on the legal rules for litigating a federal claim. It is therefore simultaneously theoretical and practical. Topics may include Congress's power to structure and regulate the federal courts, Congress's power over state courts and non-Article-III adjudication, standing and justiciability, the scope of federal jurisdiction, federal common law including implied rights of action, immunity, abstention, and concurrent jurisdiction between the state and federal courts. This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice or clerk in the federal courts. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Exam.
