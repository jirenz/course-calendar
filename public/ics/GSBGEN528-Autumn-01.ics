DESCRIPTION:Many students are prepared to be leaders, but few are prepared to be thought leaders. Yet, that's precisely what many of our students will become. This communications course focuses on the risks and the rewards of stepping into a thought leadership role as a subject matter expert or change agent in a domain of the student's choice. From the very first class students will tackle different communication elements (blogs, op-ed pieces, keynote talks, video blogs, conference panels, etc.) and receive feedback from professors and peers. By the end of this course students will: -Understand the risks and rewards of thought leadership -Identify and clearly articulate their own niche and &quot;What-If?&quot; future -Know the communication channels available to exercise thought leadership -Codify best practices and lessons learned into a forward-thinking document or framework that they can share widely -Craft a distinct message with an authentic voice across multiple channels -Build their ripples of influence by engaging their first followers and building a tribe -Begin to activate well-respected advocates who will champion their ideas -Define how to measure the success of their efforts (ex: reach, resonance) -Create a resource list of vendors, tools, technology and communities to support their thought leadership efforts -Overcome what may hold them back from stepping into the spotlight and assuming the role of thought leader in their niche.  A prequalification assignment is required for this course.  See https://goo.gl/forms/mAPC5izvC5gABJ2K2 for details and submit the survey by September 18.
