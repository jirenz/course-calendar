DESCRIPTION:Students in Afro Flows will focus on fundamentals of contemporary dance, gain fluid movement in everyday life and develop a rhythmic sensibility. This class invites participants to be more expressive and spontaneous in their movement choices. In addition to set movement warm ups, students will also learn footwork from different traditions, including tap and current social dance styles to expand their dance vocabulary. Through this approach and live percussion, students will discover their own natural rhythmic capability, as well as learn to attune with the environment and with others. No previous is experience required. Questions? Contact: Aleta Hayes (ahayes1@stanford.edu)
