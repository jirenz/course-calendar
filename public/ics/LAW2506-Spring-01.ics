DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 281)  Governance of natural resources presents difficult and contentious issues of law and public policy. Debate rages over issues such as proposals to reform the Endangered Species Act, how to manage public lands and whether to privatize them, whether the President can unilaterally revoke the protected status of national monuments, and how to prevent disastrous overfishing of the world's oceans. This course will present a survey of major areas of natural resources law, with particular attention to public-lands law (the law of national parks, forests, wilderness areas, etc.), biodiversity, and agriculture. Additional topics will include environmental justice and the constitutional dimensions of ecological challenges. Throughout the course, we will consider the historical and political context of natural resources law, examining how new ideas and social movements in the past helped to shape current laws, and asking how today's ferment might foreshadow future lawmaking. We will not treat either water law or energy law in depth.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Final Exam.
