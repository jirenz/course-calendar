DESCRIPTION:This course will focus on issues in law and business that are both important to practitioners and the subject of academic or policy debates. We will cover a range of legal and economic issues, including the following topics: nonbank lending, gatekeeper liability, capital repatriation and tax policy, corporate restructuring, blockchain and smart contracts, and cyber risk management. Each of these issues will be introduced by readings and presentations, but the classes will rely on student discussion and critical evaluation of the papers and positions we examine. Students will have the opportunity to write reaction papers that critically analyze the required readings and to learn and analyze other business law issues of their choice by working in groups. Elements used in grading:  Reaction papers, class participation, and performance in the group project and presentation.
