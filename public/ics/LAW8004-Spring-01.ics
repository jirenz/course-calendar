DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 704) The Law, Science &amp; Technology Colloquium offers students in the Law, Science &amp; Technology LLM Program the opportunity to discuss cutting-edge legal issues at the intersection of law and technology with leading experts in the field, including Stanford faculty, visiting scholars, technology and IP lawyers, entrepreneurs, and executives from Silicon Valley technology companies. During some class meetings, an invited guest lecturer will present research, a paper, or their experiences on a specific topic related to law, science, and technology. Following these presentations, students will participate with the lecturer in a discussion based on assigned readings, the presentation, and students' experience in the area. Attendance and preparation are vital to the success of the Colloquium and, accordingly, will constitute an important factor in the overall grade. Each student will also write papers that evaluate, critique, and discuss issues in the field. Students&iquest; grades are based on their papers and classroom performance (e.g., participation, attendance, etc.). This course is restricted to students in the Law, Science, and Technology LLM program, and satisfies their &iquest;Colloquium&iquest; requirement for the spring quarter.
