DESCRIPTION:This course examines the impact and implications of the rise of China in contemporary world politics from a historical and international relations perspective.  It reviews China's halting progress into the international system, sketches the evolution of PRC foreign policy since 1949, and analyzes China's developmental priorities and domestic political context as they figure into Beijing's interactions with the world.  It sketches American policy toward the PRC, and it assesses alternative approaches to dealing with China on such issues as arms and nuclear proliferation, regional security arrangements, international trade and investment, human rights, environmental problems, and the Taiwan and Tibet questions.
