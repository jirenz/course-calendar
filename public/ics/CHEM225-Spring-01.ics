DESCRIPTION:Chemistry is driven by ones understanding of structure and mechanism and ones ability to make molecules.  This course is intended to address the universal mechanistic and structural foundations of organic chemistry with an emphasis on new synthetic methods, selectivity analysis, computer-based strategies for the design and synthesis of complex molecules, concepts for innovative problems solving and, importantly, how to put these skills together in the generation of impactful ideas and proposals directed at solving problems in science as required for a career in molecular science.  Prerequisite: 223 or consent of instructor.
