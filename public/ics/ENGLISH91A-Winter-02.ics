DESCRIPTION:This is a dual purpose class: a writing workshop in which you will generate autobiographical vignettes/essays as well as a reading seminar featuring prose from a wide range of contemporary Asian-American writers. Some of the many questions we will consider are:  What exactly is `Asian-American&iquest; memoir? Are there salient subjects and tropes that define the literature? And in what ways do our writerly interactions &iquest; both resistant and assimilative &iquest; with a predominantly non-Asian context in turn recreate that context? We&iquest;ll be working/experimenting with various modes of telling, including personal essay, the epistolary form, verse, and even fictional scenarios.
