DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 796) Patentable goods and services are increasingly important in today's global information economy, and they frequently cross national borders, physically or electronically. This course will include a comparative examination of the major national patent systems, a survey of the principal international patent treaties, and discussions of related transnational patent issues. We will examine these topics both from the perspective of global patent practitioners -- who face challenges such as securing large international patent portfolios and strategizing multinational patent litigation -- and from the perspective of the academics and policymakers who are engaged in ongoing patent harmonization debates. Prerequisites: Introduction to Intellectual Property or consent of instructor.  Law students enrolled in this class will have the option of participating in a one-week extension of the course (Law 4030) in Tokyo, Japan during spring break for an additional credit.  Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 4030.  The overseas option is limited to 12 students. (See Law 4030 for application instructions and deadline).  Elements used in grading: class participation, attendance, and short writing assignments.
