DESCRIPTION:This course teaches the fundamentals of real estate investing.  The course begins by introducing the financial analysis tools that investors use to make decisions and structure deals.  Topics will include cap rates, debt and equity financing, DCF analysis, and joint ventures (among others) and then use these tools to analyze investment cases across asset and deal types.  Through case studies and with the help of industry guests, we explore land economics, market analysis, investment vehicles, risk, development, real estate tech and urban design.  The course is designed for students with limited or no background in real estate.  Students are not required to have a finance background, but students without any background in this area will need to bring an extra willingness to learn the analysis tools.
