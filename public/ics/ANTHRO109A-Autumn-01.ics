DESCRIPTION:Historical archaeology, also called the archaeology of the modern world, investigates the material culture and spatial history of the past five centures. As a discipline, historical archaeology has been characterized by (1) a methodological conjunction between history and archaeology; (2) a topical focus on the &iquest;three Cs&iquest;: colonization, captivity, and capitalism &iquest; forces which arguably are constitutive of the modern world; and (3) an epistemological priority to recovering the perspectives of &iquest;people without history.&iquest; Each of these three trends is widely debated yet they continue to profoundly shape the field. This seminar provides an in-depth examination of the emergence and development of this historical archaeology, with a focus on current issues in theory and method. For undergraduates, the prerequisite is Anthro 3 or consent of instructor.
