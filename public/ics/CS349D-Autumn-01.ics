DESCRIPTION:The largest change in the computer industry over the past five years has arguably been the emergence of cloud computing: organizations are increasingly moving their workloads to managed public clouds and using new, global-scale services that were simply not possible in private datacenters. However, both building and using cloud systems remains a black art with many difficult research challenges. This research seminar will cover industry and academic work on cloud computing and survey challenges including programming interfaces, cloud native applications, resource management, pricing, availability and reliability, privacy and security. Students will also propose and develop an original research project.n nPrerequisites: For graduate students, background in computer systems (CS 240, 244, 244B or 245) is strongly recommended. Undergrads will need instructor's approval.
