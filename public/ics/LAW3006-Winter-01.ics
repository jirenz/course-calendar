DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 368)  This seminar examines legal, social, and ethical issues arising from advances in the biosciences. This year it will focus on neuroscience.

Students who have taken the Law and the Biosciences (Genetics) seminar in past years may receive additional credit for taking this year's class. The class is open to 1Ls.
