DESCRIPTION:From economic grievances fueling conflict over territory to refugee emergencies to famine and heath inequalities, problems of regional and global development often implicate law in its various forms.  In this discussion seminar, we explore some key ideas and examples that illuminate law's role in shaping development.  Among other topics, we will examine the role of institutions in perpetuating or breaking the cycle of poverty; how geopolitical pressures affect domestic political and economic conditions; the relationship of health and wealth to well-being; the role of lawyers; and ethical questions bearing on law's role in development.  Readings will include selections from academic and policy-oriented books and articles, as well as fiction and documentary films.  Begin in Autumn Quarter and run through Winter Quarter.  Class will meet Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 6:30 - 8:30 p.m. (precise dates TBD).
