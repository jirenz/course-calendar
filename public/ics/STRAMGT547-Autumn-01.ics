DESCRIPTION:Today, technology-driven ventures continue to disrupt industries around the world and entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing economies are evolving, creating a better backdrop for entrepreneurs and investors who wish to explore high potential opportunities. Despite following the lead of Silicon Valley, the most advanced ecosystem in the world, these newly formed networks that include universities, incubators, accelerator programs, angel investor organizations and venture capital firms are still lacking. Consequently, investors and founders face distinct challenges that they would not encounter in Silicon Valley including access to local markets, lack of funding, inadequate talent pools and complex legal and political context. As developing economies grow and become more connected, new and exciting entrepreneurial opportunities arise across markets and industries. Smartphones, the best sensors on earth have already been deployed and new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Blockchain, will allow problems to be solved at a scale like never seen before. nnnThe cases and guests will reveal entrepreneurial challenges through the eyes of founders and investors that have seized these opportunities at different stages of the venture: ideation, launch and escalation.  This course is designed to showcase innovative companies in high growth industries such as consumer Internet, financial services, health care and education.  It will feature the latest trends and opportunities in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. By taking this course, you will be better equipped to observe and explain developing economy ecosystems and the opportunities and challenges they present.
