DESCRIPTION:This team-taught course brings long-time artists, organizers, and researchers to present a range of strategies for creating public art and cultural productions in various social and cultural spaces. Our exploration of public art engages ideas about social space and public discourse. An approach that finds parallels in the art history lexicon of community-based; social sculpture, and place-making to name a few of the movements identified as other than the fine arts, ours is centered on work made collectively and in social and lived spaces through dialogue and conversation with others.
