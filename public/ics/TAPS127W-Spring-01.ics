DESCRIPTION:This course is an introduction to the world and play of the theatrical clown, constructed for actors to explore truth in size, vulnerability, and a personal sense of humor.  Students will develop their ability to play with the audience, a greater capacity for freedom and abandon onstage, and a healthier relationship to failure and human idiocy.  Areas of study include partnership and status play, comic rhythm and timing, the structure and development of comic material, and the beginnings of a personal eccentric Clown character. All coursework will be experiential and practical.  Some stage experience is recommended but not required.  Some outside rehearsal/investigation time required.
