DESCRIPTION:From self-driving cars to bots that alter democratic elections, artificial intelligence is growing increasingly powerful and prevalent in our everyday lives. Fiction has long been speculating about the techno-utopia&iquest;and catastrophe&iquest;that A.I. could usher in. Indeed, fiction itself presents us with a kind of A.I. in the many characters that speak and think in its pages. So what constitutes an &iquest;intelligence&iquest; within literature or technology? In either field, is it ever possible to overcome the problem of other minds? Is there an ultimate boundary that demarcates bodies from machines? This course will begin with Mary Shelley&iquest;s Frankenstein (1818) and Edgar Allan Poe&iquest;s &iquest;Maelzel&iquest;s Chess Player&iquest; (1836), then proceed through works such as Samuel Butler&iquest;s Erewhon (1872), Isaac Asimov&iquest;s I, Robot (1950), Stanley Kubrick&iquest;s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and Stanford lecturer Scott Hutchins&iquest;s A Working Theory of Love (2012), including a possible visit from Hutchins. Throughout, we will be asking ourselves what makes someone&iquest;or something&iquest;a person in our world today.
