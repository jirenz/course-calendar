DESCRIPTION:This course examines international human rights in theory and practice. The focus is on how education may be seen as both a human rights issue as well as a tool to educate citizens about their human rights. We will discuss basic theories of human rights, investigate education as a human right, and read works that have defined it as such, including human rights documents and declarations. Students taking the class for 2 units will meet an additional hour and have the opportunity to engage with a local  education and development organization working in Central America.
