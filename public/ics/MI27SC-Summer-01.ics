DESCRIPTION:Viruses are unique biological entities that resemble both living and inanimate objects.  Despite their simple structure they include some of the most devastating and ubiquitous causes of human disease.  The compelling nature of this topic is illustrated by the recent Ebola epidemic, which emerged coincident with the last time this class was offered.  From smallpox to measles to HIV to the common cold, viruses have literally changed the course of human history and impacted evolution.  They have also been important experimental tools for probing the molecular nature of key biological processes, and they have been utilized in many key discoveries and Nobel Prize-winning research programs.  In books, movies, newspapers, and electronic feeds, viruses continue to make the news on a daily basis.  Using contemporary media, content experts, model building, interactive sessions, and field trips, we will explore the essential nature of viruses, what makes them unique, how they are classified, how they cause disease, key molecular processes, breakthroughs in prevention and treatment, current efforts in trying to eradicate viruses, and cultural iconography pertaining to viruses.  In short, this seminar is intended to go viral. Sophomore College course, applications required, due at noon on April 5, 2016. Apply at http://soco.stanford.edu .
