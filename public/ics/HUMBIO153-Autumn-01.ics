DESCRIPTION:We will learn about parasitic and other pestilence of public health importance and how they affect billions of people worldwide.  We examine the pathogenesis, clinical syndromes, complex life cycles, and the interplay among environment, vectors, hosts, and reservoirs; we explore historical contexts as it informs current interventions and programming against disease.  Public health policy initiatives aimed at halting disease transmission are viewed critically through the lens of researchers, public health level initiatives, popular media (TV and movies) and individual patients with these diseases.  There will be guest visitors who have experienced these diseases and we will hear from several researchers and experts working on the challenges of controlling, eliminating or even eradicating these diseases.  We will become familiar with the targeted diseases of the World Health Organization tropical disease research list,  including river blindness, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis and leprosy), malaria, toxoplasmosis, dracunculiasis, and intestinal helminthes.  There will be a lab section for &quot;hands on&quot; learning and viewing of parasites.  Interactive sessions will involve teaching each other about these biological forces of nature that invade humans.  Prerequisite: Human Biology core or equivalent, or consent of instructor.
