DESCRIPTION:Instructor Young Jean Lee is a playwright and director who will have two plays premiering on Broadway in 2018-2019. In this workshop, students will collaborate on the creation of one of these plays, which explores the intersection of class and race. The point of this class will be to replicate as closely as possible Lee's process for developing a new play in a professional setting. Students will &quot;learn by doing&quot; as they serve as actors, assistant directors, and dramaturgs in the same way that her actual actors, assistant directors, and dramaturgs would do. Please note that this is not designed to be an acting class with lots of fun moving around. There is no guarantee that every student will have a chance to perform. Also, Lee's new play development process is challenging, slow, and often requires sitting around a table having gruelingly intense conversations for hours at a time. This class is designed to teach students skills they need to succeed in a professional theater environment. Please contact the instructor ASAP at yjl@stanford.edu for an application, which will be be due on March 1, with notifications being sent out on March 15. If you find out about this class after the application deadline and send the instructor an email asking her to allow you to apply late, you must present a convincing explanation for why an exception should be made in your case. Nobody who misses the first class will be permitted to take the course.
