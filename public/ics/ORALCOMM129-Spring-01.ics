DESCRIPTION:This special seminar is designed for students interested in creating stories for radio, podcast, and other sound media. Students will learn both the core principles of telling strong stories, whatever the medium, and the strategies of telling entertaining, persuasive stories for the ear.  Just like film or the novel, sonic stories offer a fascinating mix of constraints and opportunities, and you&iquest;ll learn how to invite listeners into an experience or insight that combines theories, facts and feelings into a single space of empathy. This is a hybrid class&iquest;equal parts classic seminar and creative workshop&iquest;and students will create stories from start to finish and learn skills from pitching and interviewing to writing, editing, and digital production.  Students will work in small groups to document places through the stories that inhabit them. Recommended for students interested in creative nonfiction, documentary, film, and even sound art.  No prior experience necessary.  nCardinal Course/CEL/HAAS
