DESCRIPTION:This course is offered in August prior to start of fall quarter for participants of the Leland Scholars Program. This course is comprised of two parallel tracks: one focused on the development and practice of critical problem solving and study skills using wide variety of chemistry examples that illustrate the broad yet integrated nature of science; a second focused on providing an introduction to rhetorical thinking, academic writing, college-level research, and crafting well-reasoned arguments. Based on skills developed in both tracks, students will work in teams to research and present on a current issue revolving around one of five central themes: energy, climate change, water resources, medicine, and food &amp; nutrition exploring their issue from chemical, socioeconomic and cultural perspectives.
