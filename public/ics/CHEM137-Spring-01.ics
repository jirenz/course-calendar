DESCRIPTION:The course covers the design and synthesis of polymers and supramolecular complexes. Polymer chemistry is built on our understanding of reactive organic intermediates and catalysis; supramolecular chemistry is based on our understanding of non-covalent interactions. Thus, application of such understandings to the synthesis of covalent and supramolecular polymers is a central theme of this course. Modern developments in polymer chemistry have allowed the synthesis of polymers with controlled molecular weights, architectures, tacticity, and rich functionalities. Such synthetic controls in macromolecular structures lead to diverse and tunable properties and functions of the produced materials. Therefore, this course also covers basic properties and structure-property relationships of macromolecules for rational design of structures and selection of chemistry. Prerequisite CHEM 35 and 131.
