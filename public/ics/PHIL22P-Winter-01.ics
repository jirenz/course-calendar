DESCRIPTION:Grad-led tutorial. This course will explore the social dimensions of loving relationships, such as those between romantic partners, siblings, or close friends. In particular, we will explore the idea that such relationships are in important ways the product of one's social situation: that the nature, norms, and standards of friendship, for example, are not just determined by particular friends in particular friendships, but by their broader community. This investigation will broach topics in the philosophy of emotions, metaphysics, ethics, and action theory.
