DESCRIPTION:This class will provide an overview of the rapidly evolving area of distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, with a focus on economic and strategic issues.  We will cover key components of the architecture that affect the products derived from cryptocurrency.  We then consider tokens as a store of value and exchange, analyzing models of cryptocurrency pricing and as a vehicle for raising of capital.  Next, we consider use cases including payments, micropayments, asset registries, and smart contracts.  We then analyze barriers to entry in cryptocurrencies, as well as how the new products they enable affect industry structure in both the financial sector and the economy and society as a whole.  For example, how might decentralized systems like the blockchain impact the sharing economy?  The government?  We consider the governance of these decentralized systems and how decentralization affects the potential for the management and success of platforms.  We discuss the potential for national digital currencies and the end of cash.  Finally, we consider consumer protection, privacy, security, regulation, and the power of governments and regulators over borderless, decentralized systems.  Students will benefit from guest lectures by industry and thought leaders.
