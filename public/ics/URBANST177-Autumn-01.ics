DESCRIPTION:Although the word utopia was not coined by Thomas More until 1516, the idea of utopia is as old as the idea of the city itself.  Visions of a perfect society or at least a better world, variously defined have always motivated builders of cities and guided their plans. And in the 19th and 20th centuries, a series of bold utopian proposals were central to the birth, development, and practice of a modern urban planning profession that continues to shape the urban world as we enter the 21st century. This course will examine the work of the classic urban utopian visionaries Ebenezer Howard's garden cities, Arturo Soria y Mata's linear cities, Le Corbusier's skyscrapers in a park, and Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City within the larger context of the social critiques to be found in the vast literature of utopia everything from Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward of 1888 and Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia of 1975 to the many contemporary visions of cyber-cities, autonomous technologies, online communities, and previously unimagined modalities of social progress and personal liberation. Bring your imagination.
