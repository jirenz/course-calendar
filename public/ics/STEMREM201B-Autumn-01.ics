DESCRIPTION:Targeted enrollment to first year graduate students or any other student who wishes to improve their ability to design, perform, analyze, and communicate results from laboratory based experiments. Content early in the quarter is focused on how to design an experimental aim and approach. Practical examples are drawn from the participating students&iquest; fall-quarter research rotations (or current research projects). In mid-quarter, the focus shifts from how to design the experiment to &iquest;how to update the PI on this week&iquest;s experimental progress&iquest; and the weekly meeting emulates a typical lab meeting with brief presentations of experimental progress from each student. Focus shifts at the end of the quarter to strategies for concise presentation of data and conclusions drawn from experimental results. Provides hands-on skills to maximize both the student&iquest;s experience during a research rotation and improve communication skills between student and mentor (skills that are valuable to any student at any stage of their research career). SCBRM students must take concurrently with STEMREM 201A
