DESCRIPTION:This course provides an overview of the challenges and aspirations facing ideals of democracy. It deals both with competing visions of what democracy might be, and their actual realization not only in the US but around the world. It will begin with the debate over the American founding and move eventually to the &iquest;third wave&iquest; of democratization around the world in the late 20th century as well as its more recent retrenchment.  The problems of democratic reform are continuing and recurrent around the world. Democratic institutions are subject to a living dialogue and we intend to engage the students in these debates&iquest;at the level of democratic theory and at the level of specific institutional designs.
