DESCRIPTION:The past few years has seen a growth in scholars investigating the complex identities and histories of Black/Afro-Germans. While other groups in the African Diaspora have one common story (i.e. slavery in the context of the Americas), the same cannot be said for Afro-Germans. Their stories are varied and cannot be explained with one narrative. nnThis course seeks to introduce students to varied Afro-German voices and experiences through literature, film, and theory. Students in this course can expect to:n- develop skills in literary, art and performance analysisn- weigh the historical, political, social, cultural and ideological aspects of race in Germanyn- think about the way Afro-Germans complicate German national identityn- recognize contributions of Afro-GermansnThis course will be taught in English, but German-speaking students are encouraged to read in the original.
