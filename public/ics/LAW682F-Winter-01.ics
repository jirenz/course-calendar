LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:As the election of 2016 underscored, we in the United States live in a polarized and fractured society, where there is, increasingly, a lack of interaction, dialog, and understanding between groups.  In this discussion seminar, we will try to escape our particular niches and enclaves to seek the perspectives of those who occupy different segments of contemporary American society.  In so doing, we will engage fundamental questions about identity, difference, and how best to build a new pluralism.  We will work with students to compile our final reading list, though the list will include some of the following:  Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me; J.D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy:  A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis; George Packer, The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America; Jessica Valenti, Sex Object; Arlie Hochschild, Strangers in Their Own Land; Katherine J. Cramer, The Politics of Resentment:  Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker;  Domingo Martinez, The Boy Kings of Texas; and T.M. Luhrmann, When God Talks Back:  Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God.  Begin in Autumn Quarter and run through Winter Quarter. Class meeting dates:  Five Tuesday Evenings from 7:00 -- 9:00 (precise dates TBD).
