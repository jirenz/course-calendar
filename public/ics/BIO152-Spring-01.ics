DESCRIPTION:This intensive laboratory and discussion course will provide participants with the theoretical and practical knowledge to utilize emerging imaging technologies based on light microscopy. Topics include microscope optics, resolution limits, K&ouml;hler illumination, confocal microscopy, fluorescence, two-photon, TIRF, FRET, photobleaching, super-resolution (SIM, STED, STORM/PALM), and live-cell imaging. Applications include using fluorescent probes to analyze subcellular localization and live cell-translocation dynamics. We will be using a flipped classroom for the course in that students will watch iBiology lectures before class, and class time will be used for engaging in extensive discussion. Lab portion involves extensive in-class use of microscopes in the Stanford Cell Sciences Imaging Facility (CSIF) and Neuroscience Microscopy Core (NMS) microscopy facilities. Monday/Wednesday 1:30-2:50PM, Friday 1:30-4:30PM for 6 weeks (Apr. 2 - May 9), 3 units
