DESCRIPTION:Using the concept behind the Post-Studio art practice as a starting point, this course will explore what it means to make art outside (in a landscape/cityscape, etc.) instead of inside the traditional Art Studio. With technology and equipment getting smaller and more handy and with the endless stream of apps and functions available on cell phones and other mobile devices, this course will furthermore investigate how this gives the artist the ability to work on the fly and produce most of their artwork on site. Given the interdisciplinary nature of this course, the students will be given 3 assignments throughout this course, where they will be introduced to sound, video, photography, and performance art. The goal of this course is to challenge the students to think differently about the use of their mobile devices and tablets and to be creative and experimental on the spot.
