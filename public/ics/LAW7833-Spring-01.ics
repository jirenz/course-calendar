DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 629) The Spanish for Lawyers course offers students the opportunity to enhance existing Spanish communication skills in legal practice. The course will emphasize speaking and listening comprehension through in-class presentations and dialogue. Students will also be given assignments to be completed outside of class. The course will introduce Spanish legal terminology in areas such as immigration, consumer protection, criminal, employment, housing and family law. Students will learn how to apply these language skills as future legal practitioners interacting with clients who possess limited English proficiency. Native or fluent guest participants will expose students to legal terminology, concepts and dialects from various Spanish-speaking countries. The goal of the class is to enable students to, at a minimum, conduct intake interviews with a Spanish-speaking client without the assistance of an interpreter in a culturally competent fashion. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.
