DESCRIPTION:A lecture and discussion series designed for freshmen who want to learn more about Human Biology - either the major itself or the topics within its realm - by hearing from some of HumBio's most engaging faculty. Each week the class will feature a faculty member addressing three central questions: What do I do? Why is it important? and What professional opportunities are possible for a person concentrating in my field? The course is not meant to cover a specific body of content, therefore the assignments for the class aim to build fundamental study skills. These include taking useful notes, articulating questions or ideas prompted by the presentations, visiting office hours, connecting lecture topics with current events or journal articles, paying full courteous attention to speakers and peers, and creating a study guide. There will be no required readings or exams.
