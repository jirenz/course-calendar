DESCRIPTION:This is a compressed course that covers analytic and data science tools that are currently being used to operate some of the most exciting online marketplaces in the world. This course will consist of guest lectures from industry practitioners involved in these efforts and is designed to be a follow up to  OIT 272 and OIT 275, emphasizing practical challenges associated to implementing the tools and methods covered on those courses. Having taken OIT 272 or OIT 275 is highly recommended because we will assume knowledge from them, but they are not required. We will cover application areas such as transportation, rentals, sharing, e-commerce, labor markets, and advertising.
