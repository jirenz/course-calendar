DESCRIPTION:This course will examine the implications of psychological theory and research for normative legal theory and for contemporary legal policies, procedures, and practices. The course will draw on contemporary cognitive, social, and clinical psychology to address the concepts of intent, responsibility, deterrence, retribution, morality, and procedural and distributive justice. We will examine evidence law (e.g. eyewitness testimony, polygraphy, expert testimony, psychiatric diagnosis and prediction), procedure (e.g., trial conduct, jury selection, settlement negotiations, alternative dispute resolution), and various topics in criminal law, torts, contracts, property, discrimination, family law, and other areas. We will compare &quot;rational actor&quot; and psychological perspectives on decision making by juries, judges, attorneys, and litigants.  Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Series of shorter papers or final independent research paper totaling 28 pages.
