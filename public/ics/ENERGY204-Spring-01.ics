DESCRIPTION:Today 1.2 billion people have no access to electricity; many more don't have power that is reliable. Activities the developed world counts on for economic growth are severely limited where there isn't reliable electricity. Cost reductions in distributed, renewable energy generation and battery storage technologies are creating opportunities to bring affordable power to communities that have never had it.  This course will examine what will need to be in place so that electricity can reach everyone by 2030.
