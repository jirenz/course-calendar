DESCRIPTION:In this class we will move beyond definitions of disability as &quot;abnormality&quot; or &quot;deviance&quot; to explore how advances in science, technology, medicine, and culture have transformed our understanding of what constitutes a &quot;normal' human body. We will ask how arguments about disability incorporate concepts such as neurodiversity, chronic illness, and other invisible conditions. At the same time, we will study how contemporary perspectives on disability interact with issues such as technology, metaphors of the prosthesis, cultural constructions of the body, and even what it means to be human.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
