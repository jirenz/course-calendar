DESCRIPTION:This 3 unit course is a case study based course designed for those students interested in entrepreneurship and/or investing. The partnership (and interaction) between the entrepreneur and the investor is a very important dimension in the growth of many start-ups. This course examines the entrepreneur and investor relationship from both the entrepreneur's and the investor's perspectives.n nFrom the point of view of the entrepreneur -- we look at how an entrepreneur can select the most suitable investor and match the investor to the growth trajectory of their company. Students will learn how and when to approach investors as well as the positioning of their company to the investment firms' portfolio strategy. Each year we have a range in students' entrepreneurial experience and their enthusiasm. Many students begin the course with a business idea (an original idea for this course or a business idea used in another GSB course). Other students will use a &quot;borrowed&quot; business idea from a recent start up to test the waters of the entrepreneurial experience. The course gives all levels of entrepreneurs the opportunity to understand the current investing environment in class and in the field. Students have enjoyed connecting with members of the entrepreneur &amp; VC community as they interact with the guest speakers and complete the course projects.n nFrom the point of view of the investor -- we look at the rapid evolution of the investor sector; in particular, why entrepreneurs have many more investor alternatives today compared to several years ago. It is important for entrepreneurs (and future investors) to understand investors' motivation and process. We will explain how investors are differentiating their firm in an &quot;entrepreneur's market&quot;, look for their next opportunity, their investment selection process and how investors plan to work with the entrepreneur after the investment. nnThe course is geared for multiple audiences: the student who is considering an entrepreneurship or investment career path, the student who &quot;experimenting&quot; with entrepreneurship for the first time or the entrepreneur who is seriously exploring a start-up idea (and perhaps has already formed a team). Each student audience will benefit from the candid guest speakers discussion as to what happens behind the scenes (e.g. in the investors' partners meeting) and at the negotiating table between the entrepreneur and investor.nnThe course is case study based with engaging class discussions led by your two teachers who collectively have over 70 years of experience as venture capitalists. The course includes frequent guest speakers (both entrepreneurs and investors) who will give alternate and candid off the record details about their experiences. nnClass participation is integral to a successful exchange of ideas; therefore, we encourage class participation and it will count as 50% of your total grade. The other 50% of the grade is based on individual papers, a short presentation to the class, and your individual contribution to a presentation project to an investor panel. Notably, this year's course allows students to choose their role as the entrepreneur, investor or angel adviser for the final presentation to the VC panel (in contrast to previous years' requirement, this year students will be graded for their individual contribution rather than as a team for the final group project).
