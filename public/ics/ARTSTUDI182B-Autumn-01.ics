DESCRIPTION:Through experience-based exercises this class will build upon students understanding of conceptual art. Student will be guided in the exploration of their ideas beginning with the parameters set by the camera and later by specific place(s) and space(s) in and around campus. Throughout the quarter students will learn to process and poetically interpret their ideas as well time, space, the self and current sociopolitical issues in a manner that best suites each idea. In class activities will address curiosities to invoke a deeper investigation of each student's relationship to art and/or their individual field of study. This seminar will include a survey of art historical examples to help stimulate ideas, discussions and activities. Visiting artists as well as off-campus studio visits will further inform the course.
