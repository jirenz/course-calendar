DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1.  In this class, we will research how collaboration between and among producers and consumers shapes our society. For example, we'll look at how <i>Harry Potter </i>and <i>Star Wars </i>fans have influenced their franchises marketing and how advocates for open information (like WikiLeaks) have impacted the political climate. We'll debate the impacts of collaborative efforts and consider both the rewards and risks that arise from collaboration. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
