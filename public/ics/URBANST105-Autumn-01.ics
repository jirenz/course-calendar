DESCRIPTION:This course introduces undergraduate students to the theory and methods of the geospatial approaches to urban problems like gentrification through urban storytelling, i.e.,listening  to the stories that people tell about their experience in the city and interpreting these narratives with the aforementioned tools and analytical framework. nn	Using social media, History pin software, Detour (Walking Tours,) and other spatial theory and technical learning methodologies including Google Street view and Tagging collectives, we will take Walking Tours through Oakland to understand gentrification. Students will select one of five areas of Oakland and interview people and record their stories.  This is a course that is place-based audio storytelling with the Detour software that is used in Stanford&iquest;s Media X department.nn	As an urban storyteller, the student learns that stories are place-based.  Next, the student learns how to find a Narrator, who can tell the story, and;  finally, the student must  discover what the story really is.nn	We will meet the President of  SPUR, an important lobbying organization for Oakland. We will also visit rapper and political leader, Boots Reily, and Radio DJ JR, visit with the Oakland Mayor, Libby Schaaf, and finally an interview with Crazy Kyle, who is self-described as a &iquest;White Negro.&iquest;	nn	Thus, the Urban Storyteller is both an observer and a participant who speaks to us about race, ethnicity, hip-hop, and gentrification in the American City, such as Oakland. The Corner is the place-based site for the intersection of oral and digital culture. But the Walking Tour is more dynamic.
