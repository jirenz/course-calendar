DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 650) Advanced Negotiation courses are designed to take students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar, to examine many facets of negotiation complexity, both in terms of the participants and topics. This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems in the economic development, environmental, and health policy sectors. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a selected case analysis (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue). Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 7821) or its substantial equivalent. Advanced degree students (and graduate students in other departments and programs) are encouraged to enroll provided that they have previous negotiation training or equivalent practice experience. Elements used in grading: Class participation and engagement, including simulations; attendance; preparation for and contributions to discussion; and short written assignments.
