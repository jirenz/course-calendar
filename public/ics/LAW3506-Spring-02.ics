DESCRIPTION:This course will examine the interrelationship between legal norms and empire in the history of the United States.  Topics in this part will include the Constitution as an imperial document; law and the expansion of the United States in western North America, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii; the Insular Cases; and current debates over extraterritoriality and the War on Terror.  Substantial readings will consist of scholarly articles, historical cases, and primary sources, and will be provided online. Requirements for the course include regular class participation and, at the students' election, either response papers or a historiographical essay.  Students may also elect to complete a research paper, in which case they will receive 3 units and &quot;R&quot; credit. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Cross-listed with History (HISTORY 354F).
