DESCRIPTION:Detective fiction is one of the most popular genres in the world. It is also, interestingly, one of the most international genres as well. In this course, we&iquest;ll look at a selection of globally oriented detective stories, from the Sherlock Holmes to The Tunnel, and explore the ways in which detective fiction participates in the global imagination. How do these detective stories represent the tension between community and cultural difference? How do conceptions of cultural or racial &iquest;otherness&iquest; influence views of suspicion, guilt or innocence? How far does detective fiction fulfill a cosmopolitan ideal of transnational justice, and in what ways does it fall short? As we analyze the conventions of the detective genre and consider how it examines issues faced by our increasingly globalized community&iquest;including immigration, imperialism, identity politics, and terrorism&iquest;we&iquest;ll ask larger questions about the nature of community, morality, law, and justice across national and cultural boundaries.
