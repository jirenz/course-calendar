DESCRIPTION:There has been a rapid evolution of digital means of communicating with consumers and advertising to them, driven by changes in technologies and consumer behavior.  Readership of traditional print media has gone down dramatically, and television is consumed very differently now than even a few years ago, with the advent of digital video recording and  streaming video platforms.  This has led to a dramatic growth of marketing using digital platforms.  Furthermore, a variety of avenues for digital marketing has emerged, including display advertising, search advertising, advertising on online video platforms, advertising and other forms of engagement on social networks etc. A recent trend has been the rapid growth of mobile platforms, which include these different avenues also available. An integrated view of using these different media to market to consumers is important to effective digital marketing.  With the rapid acceptance of numerous &quot;Big Data&quot; technologies by large enterprises, online marketing is also evolving to incorporate a customer-centric view rather than a campaign centric view.  This course will explore these issues.
