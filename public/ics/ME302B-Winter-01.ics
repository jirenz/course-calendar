DESCRIPTION:Automated vehicles are on the verge to productization and have been subject to a lot of news recently: GM bought a self-driving tech startup for presumably more than $1 billion. BMW, Intel and MobilEye teamed up to &quot;bring fully autonomous driving to streets by 2021&quot;. Uber acquired Otto (another startup) for reportedly $680 million to lead Uber&iquest;s self-driving car effort. MobilEye and Delphi announced &quot;a partnership for Level 4/5 automated Driving solution for 2019&quot;. Ford announced to put a fleet of Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road in 2021. Tesla is continuing to working on its Autopilot. Intel bought MobilEye. Sounds exciting &iquest; if you have an idea what the terms and levels mean, and what the technology actually is, which is driving the vehicle automation.&nbsp;This class will provide a holistic introduction to the field of vehicle automation: The first three lectures will provide an overview, clarify terminology and categories, and dive into the legal and policy aspects of automated driving. The next three lectures discuss the technologies enabling vehicle automation and outline applications. Students are asked to work on a class assignment in groups discussing current topics of vehicle automation. The results of the group work will be presented in the final 2 lectures of the class.&nbsp;This is the second course&nbsp;of a 3-quarter seminar series, which build on one another but can be taken independently. This course, lectured by an industry expert, will introduce students to the technology behind the systems, the benefits, challenges, and future perspectives of this exciting field. Students will develop an understanding for the interactions of the technology, business, and public&nbsp;policies&nbsp;with a specific automotive focus.
