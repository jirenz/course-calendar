DESCRIPTION:This seminar explores the ritual contexts of the painting, sculpture, and architecture of late medieval Italy.  Rituals structured almost every aspect of life in Italian towns.  Elaborately choreographed rites of passage marked the great events of the life cycle, from pregnancy and childbirth to marriage to death.  Each town&iquest;s ritual calendar established the rhythms of the year.  Major feast days were celebrated with all the pageantry of the late medieval Church. Crises &iquest; whether famine or plague or the threat of war &iquest; spawned their own ritual responses, often penitential processions of flagellants.  The course considers the ways in which works of art register, respond to and participate in these rites. The last part of the course will focus on one of the most important and distinctive ritual spaces in late medieval Italy, the baptistery.  Works to be studied include some by the greatest painters and sculptors of the era:  the painters Duccio, Giotto, Simone Martini, Ambrogio Lorenzetti and Pietro Lorenzetti, and the sculptors Nicola Pisano and Giovanni Pisano.
