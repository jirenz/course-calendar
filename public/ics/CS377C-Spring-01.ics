DESCRIPTION:This project-based class focuses on the design of social computing and crowdsourcing systems. Students will learn how to engage large groups of people online, from microtask crowdsourcing to the design of online communities. The course will cover best practices for system design such as motivating participation, ethical guidelines, agreement measures, and gold standards. Advanced topics such as expert and team-based crowdsourcing, incentive design, and complex crowd workflows will also be discussed. Students will learn about the application of crowdsourcing to other areas of computer science, and how the field relates to social psychology and organizational behavior. Prerequisite: CS 147.
