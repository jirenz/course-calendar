DESCRIPTION:This course combines lectures with hands-on labs to give students a solid understanding of the most common types of attacks used in cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Taught by a long-time cybersecurity practitioner, each session will begin with a lecture covering the basics of an area of technology and how that technology has been misused in the past. Students will then complete a lab section, with the guidance of the instructor and assistants, where they attack a known insecure system using techniques and tools seen in the field. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a working knowledge of the most popular hacking techniques seen in the wild and the basic skills necessary to power further exploration. Students are required to bring a Windows or Mac laptop and will be provided with testing virtual machines. No computer science background is required. Only open to non-CS majors (for 2017-18).
