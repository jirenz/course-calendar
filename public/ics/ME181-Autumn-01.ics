DESCRIPTION:The goal of this course is to enable students to solve industry design challenges using modern mechanical design methods. Each week a new practical skill is introduced. These skills have been identified by recently graduated Stanford engineers as being critical to their work. Students then build their command of each skill by completing a simplified yet representative project and submitting deliverables similar to those required in industry. For example, students will learn about how to properly design parts with O-rings and then will be required to design a water-tight enclosure and submit CAD, mechanical drawings, and a bill of materials. Several of the classes feature recent Stanford graduates as guest lecturers. In addition to teaching applicable skills from their job and providing examples from industry, these engineers will also expose students to the range of responsibilities and daily activities that makeup professional mechanical design work. Prerequisites: ME203, ME103d and ME112 OR consent of instructor. Enrollment limited, students complete application on first day of class
