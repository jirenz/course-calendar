DESCRIPTION:Spurred, in part, by the events of September 11th and the plight of American service members returning from combat experiences in the Middle East, the public's gaze has been drawn toward the concept of trauma. This course considers the rhetorics of trauma, that is, how survivors of traumatic incidents, witnesses, psychologists, doctors, civil and military leaders, politicians, and the general public interpret trauma. These different understandings of trauma compete for social awareness and limited resources. For more information about PWR 1, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
