DESCRIPTION:Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) starts by understanding the client's objectives for building performance and the translation of these objectives into measurable project and production objectives.  Based on a culture of proactive and constructive engagement, three mutually supportive strategies are essential to achieve these objectives: (1) the knowledge of the many disciplines contributing to the design and construction of a buildable, usable, operable, and sustainable building needs to be orchestrated concurrently, (2) the information supporting the project team must be integrated and be accessible seamlessly, and (3) the workflow carried out by the project team must enable the creation of integrated knowledge and information and lead to decisions that stick.  This course will teach all the essential elements of VDC.  Prerequisite: 100 or consent of instructor.  Recommended:  CEE 240, CEE 241.
