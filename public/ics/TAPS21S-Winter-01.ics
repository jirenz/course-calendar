LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This class prepares students to tell their stories in front of the audience for Beyond Sex Ed: Intimacy &amp; Relationships in Spring 2018. Do we need love? And if so, what does it look like? In this class, students will learn about relationships from the inside-out: through an examination and telling of their lived experiences. We will explore various perspectives on intimacy and relationships that illuminate different aspects of our lives, and then dive into our own stories to discover the many facets of intimacy. Due to the personal nature of the topic, we will emphasize safety, trust, and confidentiality throughout. The class offers the structure and guidance to 1) mine your life for stories, 2) craft the structure and shape of your stories, and 3) perform with presence, authenticity, and connection.
