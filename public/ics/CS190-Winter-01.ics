DESCRIPTION:This course will teach the art of software design: how to decompose large complex systems into classes that can be implemented and maintained easily. Topics include information hiding, thick classes, API design, managing complexity, and how to write in-code documentation. The class will involve significant system software implementation and will use an iterative approach consisting of implementation, review, and revision. The course will be taught in a studio format with in-class discussions and code reviews in addition to lectures. Prerequisites: CS 140. Application and consent of instructor required. Apply at: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs190
