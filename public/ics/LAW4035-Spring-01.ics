DESCRIPTION:Was Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections an act of war? When do cyber attacks constitute a use of force? Is sovereignty in cyberspace different than in other domains, and can states meaningfully defend their sovereignty in cyberspace? Is &quot;hacking back&quot; against cyber thieves the legal equivalent of defending one's own property? This course explores the domestic and international law of cyberspace and its application to significant practical challenges. It also addresses broader legal policy questions, including the extent to which law acts as a constraint on state and non-state actors in cyberspace, whether the application of existing law to cyber activities is sufficient or new laws and norms are needed, and how they could be developed. Policy and law students are welcome; no previous legal knowledge is required.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, class participation, writing assignments, and a final exam.  Cross-listed with International Policy Studies (IPS 269).
