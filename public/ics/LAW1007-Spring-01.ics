DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 722)  This course will provide advanced-degree students with coverage of Contracts law comparable to the fall course offered for first-year JD students. The course will identify the scope and purpose of the legal protection accorded to interests created by voluntary undertakings. We will focus on problems of contract formation, enforceability, interpretation, performance and excuses for non-performance, and remedies for breach. The course will cover both the U.S. common law of contracts and the basics of UCC Article 2 (sales of goods).  Not open to JD students. Open only to students in the SLS Advanced Degree Programs. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Final Exam.
