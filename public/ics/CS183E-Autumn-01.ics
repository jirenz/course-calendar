DESCRIPTION:You will undoubtedly leave Stanford with the technical skills to excel in your first few jobs. But non-technical skills are just as critical to making a difference. This seminar is taught by two industry veterans in engineering leadership and product management. In a small group setting, we will explore how you can be a great individual contributor (communicating with clarity, getting traction for your ideas, resolving conflict, and delivering your best work) and how you can transition into leadership roles (finding leadership opportunities, creating a great team culture, hiring and onboarding new team members). We will end by turning back to your career (picking your first job and negotiating your offer, managing your career changes, building a great network, and succeeding with mentors). Prerequisites: Preference given to seniors and co-terms in Computer Science and related majors. Enrollment limited and application required for admittance.
