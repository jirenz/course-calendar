DESCRIPTION:Data and algorithms are transforming law enforcement and criminal justice, a shift that is ripe for rigorous empirical and narrative exploration. This class is centered around several data-driven projects in criminal justice, with the goal of fostering greater understanding, transparency, and public accountability. Students work in interdisciplinary teams, using a combination of statistical and journalistic methods. Some of the work may be published by news organizations or may be used to advance data journalism investigations. Students with a background in statistics, computer science, law, public policy or journalism are encouraged to participate. Enrollment is limited, and project teams will be selected during the first week of class.
