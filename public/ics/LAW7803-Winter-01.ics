DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 545)  Clients in disputes increasingly call for lawyers with skill within a broad range of alternative dispute resolution processes. In this course, you will learn about the variety of dispute resolution procedures that operate under the ADR umbrella, within and outside of the court system (including mediation and arbitration). The goal is for students to understand the law and policy behind these alternatives relative to court adjudication, to be able to select the appropriate process for a client, and to effectively represent that client in the selected process. The teaching team includes third party neutrals and advocates from a range of contexts, including federal court, private mediation, private and public arbitration, and corporate legal counsel.  Special class on Saturday, Feb. 24, 9a-3p.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02) which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, discussion; three written assignments, final paper.
