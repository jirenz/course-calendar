DESCRIPTION:Playwright Anton Chekhov helped revolutionize the theater with his naturalistic representation of life onstage.  In this course, students will explore the creation of character and ensemble by doing scenes from Chekhov's plays with a particular focus on relationship, subtext, sensory life, and Russian history and culture in 1900.  Students will practice the improvisational technique of Active Analysis to connect with and embody characters and events, as well as exploring various exercises of Michael Chekhov's such as the Psychological Gesture, and exercises involving tempo-rhythm, physical centers, and archetypes. Prerequisite: Acting 120A. Priority given to TAPS majors and minors.
