DESCRIPTION:This course is for students who may want to undertake an entrepreneurial career by starting and/or managing a social venture.  It covers traditional topics in starting and growing a venture - venture creation, resource acquisition, managing growth and harvest/exit - in the context of social enterprises.  It is our view that, in most ways, social ventures should be treated and managed like for-profit ventures, and this course reflects this perspective.  That said, there are some important differences which are critical to understand to effectively start and manage a social enterprise.  We will highlight these throughout our sessions, so while many of the lessons learned are generalizable to all ventures, we don't advise you to take this class unless you really want to learn about social ventures.  All the cases and class discussions will be exclusively about enterprises and organizations in the social venture space.nnThe class deals primarily with situations from the point of view of the entrepreneur/manager, and in a couple of cases, from the perspective of the investor. Students will have a chance to assess opportunity and action in the context of actual social ventures, often in situations that are current. The course is integrative and will allow students to apply many facets of their business school education. We will have a mixture of case discussions, student-led in-class exercises, panel discussions, and guest speakers.
