DESCRIPTION:Introduction to basic concepts and issues in the linguistic study of word meaning. We explore grammatical regularities in word meaning and the relation between word meaning and the conceptual realm.&nbsp;The questions we address include the following. How is the meaning of a word determined from its internal structure? &nbsp;How can simple words have complex meanings? &nbsp;What is a possible word? &nbsp;How does a word's&nbsp;meaning determine the word's syntactic distribution and what kind of reasoning does it support? What kind of information belongs to the lexical entry of a word? &nbsp;The course will show that the investigation&nbsp;of the linguistic and semantic structure of words draws on the full resources of linguistic theory and methodology. Prerequisites:&nbsp;Linguist 1&nbsp;or equivalent or permission of the instructor.&nbsp;Linguist 130A&nbsp;is not a prerequisite for this course.
