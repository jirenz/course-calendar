DESCRIPTION:What changes in a musician's brain after hours and years of daily practice? How do skills that make a great violinist transfer to other abilities? Can directed neuroplasticity be used to target skill learning? This course will include fundamentals of psychoacoustics and auditory neuroscience. Focus will be development of video games that use perceptually motivated tasks to drive neural change. Emphasis will be on music, linguistic, and acoustic based skills. Programming experience is highly recommended, but not required.
