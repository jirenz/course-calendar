DESCRIPTION:We have to grow up. We have no choice in the matter. But what does this lack of choice mean for the way experience growing up&iquest;either as a tragedy or perhaps not? This course will explore various writers&iquest; approaches to one of the defining genres of the novel, the bildungsroman, the story of finding one&iquest;s place in the world. We all negotiate between our youthful dreams and the compromises of experience. How do we forge our storylines? By choosing a vocation? A romantic partner? By moving from the country to the city, or from one country to another? Reading stories from Victorian and modernist Britain as well as contemporary America, we will question the variety of ways in which the bildungsroman explores questions of identity formation, social changes, and experiments in literary form. Readings include works by Charlotte Bront&euml;, Charles Dickens, D.H. Lawrence, Gertrude Stein, Jeffrey Eugenides, Junot D&iacute;az, and Hayao Miyazaki.
