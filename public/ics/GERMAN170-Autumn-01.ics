DESCRIPTION:Theodor W. Adorno (1903-1969) was one of the most influential German thinkers of the 20th century. This seminar aims to introduce students to Adorno's varied oeuvre, from his contributions to the critique of culture, his theory of history, his re-thinking of Hegelianism and Marxism, to his contributions to aesthetics. We will also consider Adorno's various intellectual forebears, collaborators and interlocutors (Hegel, Marx, Luk&aacute;cs, Horkheimer, Habermas). All texts and discussions are in English. Undergraduates welcome.
