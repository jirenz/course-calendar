DESCRIPTION:The last hundred years have seen organized environmentalism become a major force on the world stage. But the environment is still essentially contested. Who is at risk from environmental problems? What environmental problems should be prioritized? And who should be able to speak out as authentic protectors of the earth? In this course, we examine the ways that environmental and conservation writers from classic environmental writers to contemporary activists talk about nature to see how close readings of their work highlight fundamental disagreements about justice and politics in societies across the globe. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. For more information about PWR 1, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
