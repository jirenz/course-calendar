DESCRIPTION:This graduate-level seminar will be taught simultaneously on the campuses of Stanford University and Peking University and will feature a lecture series in which prominent American and Chinese scholars provide presentations that focus on key global security issues.  The course content will highlight topics relevant to current U.S.- China relations and their respective roles in Asian and global security.  Proposed lecture topics include: an introduction to U.S.- China relations; finance, trade, and investment; cyber security; nonproliferation; maritime security; terrorism; and energy and the environment.  Hosted jointly by Stanford University and Peking University, enrollment will be limited to 20 students at each campus and, at Stanford, will be restricted to graduate students and undergraduates with senior standing.  Enrollment is competitive, so potential students must complete an application by March 12, 2018 at 5pm:  https://web.stanford.edu/dept/CEAS/EASTASN285.fb
