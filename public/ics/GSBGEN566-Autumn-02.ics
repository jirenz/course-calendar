DESCRIPTION:GSBGEN 566 is an elective course offered to 2nd-year MBA and MSx students. The goal of this course is to improve students' judgment in confronting challenging, real business situations encountered in the normal progression of corporate activities. The course aims to sharpen moral reasoning and build judgment without favoring a particular position. The course will be taught by Mark Leslie and Peter Levine, Lecturers.  This course is taught using &quot;vignettes&quot;. At the beginning of each class students will be given a one-page reading that describes a business situation which requires a decision to be made.  After in-depth discussion, a second page will be handed out, describing how the situation actually unfolded and challenges the class with new information.  This new information typically changes the dynamics of the case and requires a new decision to be made.  Often there is a third and fourth page that continues the dialogue.  Frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing will be employed in the development of the session.  Note that for most classes there is little or no advanced preparation required, which is often the case when making real-world business decisions. Cases are drawn from a wide selection of actual business challenges with protagonists joining the class as guests whenever available.  Vignettes are based on topics such as raising venture capital, managing major industrial customers, product distribution agreements, board of director and fiduciary conflicts, developing financial instruments, senior management issues, work/life balance, etc. The class is extremely engaging - it is quite usual to find continuing discussion of the day's case outside the classroom among small groups of students. This class is for two GSB credits and will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Sixty percent of the final grade will be derived from classroom performance; the remainder will be based on a final written assignment describing a personal ethical situation that the student has faced in their careers.
