DESCRIPTION:Two of the biggest challenges humanity has to face - promoting human health and halting environmental degradation are are strongly connected and too big to be addressed in an incremental, sector-specific way. Breakthroughs can be achieved through a creative, interdisciplinary approach that fully recognizes the complex nature of links between human health and healthy, functioning ecosystems.  Through a series of lectures and case-study discussions with experts from multiple Schools and Departments, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the &quot;Planetary Health&quot; concept, its foundation, goals, priority areas of action and methods of investigation, and the most relevant immediate and long-term challenges.
