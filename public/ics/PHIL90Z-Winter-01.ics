DESCRIPTION:This course provides an introduction to some of the topics of contemporary analytic philosophy including free-will, moral responsibility, and moral luck through the lens of the US criminal justice system. The course is divided into roughly three sections. In the first, we examine the intersection between action and justice: in particular, the ascription of mens rea (i.e., guilty mind) to individuals accused/convicted of crimes and how these ascriptions are justified. In the second, we explore the topics of free-will and responsibility, topics which are central to many rationales undergirding criminal punishment both in theoretical literature as well as within society more broadly. Finally, in the third section, we will look at various philosophical justifications of punishment and how these relate to legislative policies within the criminal justice system.
