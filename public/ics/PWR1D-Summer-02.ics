Emphases include close reading, analysis of varied texts, development of strong theses, revision strategies, and introduction to research-based argument.  Classes are small, encouraging extensive interaction between students and instructors. Discussions of readings, peer work, and individual conferences with instructors.  Each section has a thematic emphasis developed by the instructor; students choose sections based on their individual interests. Does not meet the Stanford first-year writing requirement.
