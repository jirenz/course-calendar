DESCRIPTION:War exposes the most barbarous face of human nature, so the notion that societies can impose order and morality on warfare may seem paradoxical and even futile. Yet throughout history, people have sought to&iquest;and indeed succeeded in&iquest;humanize war. Who are the political actors that have attempted this Herculean task? What strategies have they taken to do so? What are the laws, norms, and organizations structure the ways in which wars are fought? This course will answer these questions, drawing primarily from political science theory and evidence.
