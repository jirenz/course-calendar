DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 715A) Asking questions is at the core of the role of an attorney. Whether it is interviewing a potential new client, interrogating a witness in a deposition, or conducting a direct or cross examination at trial, knowing how to ask a question is an essential lawyering skill. We'll explore textual materials and real life case examples in transcripts, videotape, and cinema to determine the principals and best practices for questioning. We'll learn how to prepare for questioning, how to focus, narrow, and broaden an examination, how to obtain key admissions, how to deal with a difficult opponent, when to stop asking, and how to use what's been obtained in court or otherwise to win for your clients. This course will give you the skills and tools needed for the critical roles of understanding your clients and your cases and successfully representing their causes.  Class attendance is required.  Shanin Specter is a founding partner of Kline &amp; Specter, P.C., in Philadelphia, concentrating in catastrophic injury litigation. He has obtained more than 200 settlements or verdicts in excess of $1 million and is a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, whose membership is limited to the top 100 plaintiffs' attorneys in the United States. Elements used in grading: assessment of two brief and one longer reaction papers, as well as classwork.
