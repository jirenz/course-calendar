DESCRIPTION:This seminar traces the proliferation of populism in contemporary Europe and the United States, with reference to the historical background of  of anti-institutional and anti-representational ideas of popular sovereignty. Subjects include: the notion of 'vox populi' from the early middle ages to the early modern period; ideas of radical democracy in the enlightenment era; 19th century notions of identifying 'the people' (nation, 'Volk', class, race, mass); the populist, reform and volkish movements around 1900; the rise of fascist and totalitarian ideas of popular sovereignty; the struggle over the meaning of democracy in the Cold War era; semantic transformations of 'the popular' through the audio-visual media; and the rise of today's populism since 1989. The material to be analyzed will consist of 1. Primary sources (programs, manifests, pamphlets, speeches and propaganda material including visual sources); 2. Contemporary theoretical texts (political philosophy, history, sociology, psychology, and popular science); and 3. Today's theories and practices of populism. nNote: The course will be taught by Visiting Professor Christian Geulen, University of Koblenz, Germany
