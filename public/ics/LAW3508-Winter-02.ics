DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 760)  We know it when we see it. But what kind of knowledge does a smartphone or dashboard camera video offer? We tend to treat certain kinds of video as unmediated representations of reality, even though as sophisticated consumers of media we should know better.  Neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect.  But the desire that drives it--the desire for definitive proof of what did or did not happen--arises from very real experience, and is inextricably connected to the legal process.  This seminar tracks the legal reception of modern visual representation from the confusion about the admissibility of photographs in the late 19th century (is it like a drawing? is it like eyewitness testimony?) to the debate about cameras in the courtroom in the late 20th century (do judges and jurors decide differently when the proceedings are subject to public scrutiny?) to the frequent and strategic deployment of visual media in pretrial and litigation practice today.  We will also explore the prominent role of video in today's conversation about policing and race.  Course materials range from film theory to social psychology to presentations by practicing attorneys.  Special Instructions: This course can satisfy the Research &quot;R&quot; requirement. The instructor and the student must agree whether the student will receive &quot;R&quot; credit. For &quot;R&quot; credit, the paper is substantial and is based on independent research. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.
