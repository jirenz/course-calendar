DESCRIPTION:Seventy years after its founding in 1948, North Korea, or more officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),  insists on being accepted as a nuclear weapons state, and continues to defy U.S. and international sanctions and pressure.  Why the priority to nuclear and missile capabilities by this small, isolated state, and what kind of and how much of a threat is it?  Taught by a former American diplomat with forty years of Korea-related experience, including as U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, this seminar course will review the history of U.S.-North Korea relations, examining diplomatic, economic, military, and other policy tools.  The aim is to develop a broader context for understanding the North Korean challenge, identify lessons to be learned, and develop approaches going forward.
