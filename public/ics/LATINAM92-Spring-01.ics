LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:A pre-field seminar for students participating in the Volunteers in Latin America summer program in Quito, Ecuador. The seminar will introduce students to topics of international service, youth development, and the issues and challenges surrounding street children in Ecuador. The seminar seeks to provide participants with a cultural, socioeconomic, and political context in which to understand the experiences they will have when in Ecuador. Through discussions, guest speaker presentations, and readings, students will develop insights and further questions that will help them to be more confident, reflective, and empathetic participants in their in-country service learning experience. Course enrollment is restricted to those students that have committed to the summer program.
