DESCRIPTION:This course incorporates a Native American perspective in the assigned readings and is an introduction to Native American History from contact with Europeans to the present.  History, from a Western perspective, is secular and objectively evaluative whereas for most Indigenous peoples, history is a moral endeavor (Walker, Lakota Society 113).  A focus in the course is the civil rights era in American history when Native American protest movements were active.  Colonization and decolonization, as they historically occurred are an emphasis throughout the course using texts written from the perspective of the colonized at the end of the 20th century in addition to the main text.  Students will be encouraged to critically explore issues of interest through two short papers and one longer paper that is summarized in a 15-20 minute presentation on a topic of interest relating to the course.
