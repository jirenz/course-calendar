LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:From the United States to China, and from Brazil to the EU, corporate capitalism has triumphed globally as the dominant form of economic organization. Yet despite the common attributes of the corporation familiar to every U.S. law student, corporations around the world have diverse ownership structures, interact in their domestic political economies in different ways, and exhibit a host of traits that vary with the institutional context in which they operate. This seminar explores the many forms corporate capitalism takes around the world, and the important legal and policy issues raised by global corporate activity. We will explore the rise of &quot;agency capitalism&quot; in the U.S. and the proliferation of new corporate ownership structures around the world, the emergence of Chinese state capitalism and its legal and policy consequences, efforts to reform Japanese stakeholder capitalism, and hybrid forms of organization such as the &quot;benefit corporation&quot; and public-private partnerships (PPP). Policy issues to be considered include corporate social responsibility, the national security implications of investment by state-owned enterprises, and the consequences of global activist investing. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Presentation.
