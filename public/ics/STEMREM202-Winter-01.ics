LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:For graduate, undergraduate and medical students. Focus is on the fundamentals of stem cell biology and stem cell applications in basic research and translational medicine. Topics include exploration of the well-studied system of hematopoiesis, molecular pathways of pluripotency and tissue-specific stem cells and ends with coverage of aging as related to stem cell dynamics. Lectures are topically paired to cover the basic science of each topic, followed by clinical applications within each field of study. Students will use lecture and literature content to construct a research proposal or business plan based on biological or clinical concepts learned during the quarter.
