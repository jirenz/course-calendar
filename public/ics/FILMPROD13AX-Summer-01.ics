LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In this exploratory workshop, students will use the VR tools of 360 video and binaural sound design to tell immersive &quot;stories&quot;. Students will use the conceptual framework of experimental cinema and documentary film to inform their work, while also pushing toward a new artistic language in this still-emerging form of VR storytelling. Over the course of two weeks, students will work in teams to create a series of short immersive pieces, culminating in a 2-3 minute VR video, with a keen emphasis on experimentation. The course is time intensive: requiring some nights and both weekends dedicated to production and editing, including several production field trips off-campus.
