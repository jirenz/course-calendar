DESCRIPTION:Advanced reporting and writing course in the specific practices and standards of food journalism. This course begins with the assumption that students are familiar with the basics of reporting and research in journalism.  We'll take those skills and apply them to the wide territory of food journalism, from farmer's markets to food waste, from travel and cultural writing to stories about agriculture and climate change.  We will read a range of the best food journalism and students will be charged with writing both long form narrative essays and short magazine style pieces.  We'll talk about how to hone in on the truly interesting idea, how to get more out of the reporting process and how to turn the raw materials of research and interviews into polished, engaging prose. Admission by application only, available from vvc1@stanford.edu. Deadline December 4.
