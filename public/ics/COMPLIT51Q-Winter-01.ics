DESCRIPTION:We may &quot;know&quot; &quot;who&quot; we &quot;are,&quot; but we are, after all, social creatures. How does our sense of self interact with those around us? How does literature provide a particular medium for not only self expression, but also for meditations on what goes into the construction of &quot;the Self&quot;? After all, don't we tell stories in response to the question, &quot;who are you&quot;? Besides a list of nouns and names and attributes, we give our lives flesh and blood in telling how we process the world. Our course focuses in particular on this question--Does this universal issue (&quot;who am I&quot;) become skewed differently when we add a qualifier before it, like &quot;ethnic&quot;?
