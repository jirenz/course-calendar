DESCRIPTION:The future of the energy industry is deeply intertwined with politics and the formation of policy. What happens beyond the market shapes the rules of the game for market competition. In this class we'll take a deeper dive into the market and beyond-market strategies in the energy industry. Each session will address a business problem and analyze the interaction of market structure and the beyond-market environment. The business problem will either come from a written case or a guest speaker. Topics covered: 1) Mapping the regulated energy landscape: the politics and innovation of the renewable energy industry. 2) Working with State Regulators and Using the beyond-market to dislodge entrenched incumbents. 3) Beyond State Politics: The US &amp; Australian Federal Government. 4) The Utilities from inside and outside. 5) Investing in a highly regulated industry.
