DESCRIPTION:This class aims to provide a synthesis of design and technique in metalworking.  When using precious metals (silver and bronze) the scale of the works naturally becomes much smaller than other design endeavors. This intimate size allows for attention to detail and refinement not common or often considered in other areas of design.  The method involves creating a piece out of wax, and going through a process to achieve that piece in metal.  All projects will center on this process.  Students will complete complete three projects, a quick-start ring, a client design theme project and a belt.nSara and Amanda have been teaching ME298: Silversmithing in Design at Stanford for 17 years, they are full time designers at RedStart Design, LLC and also Lecturers in Design in the Mechanical Engineering Department.
