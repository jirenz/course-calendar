DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be an animal? And what does it mean to be a person? Ideas about other species&iquest;how they think and feel, act and react&iquest;involve categories such as race, gender, class and ability in often-surprising ways. This course will trace the relationship between animal life and human identity in twentieth-century American fiction, from the advent of Darwinian thought to contemporary animal advocacy. Readings will include Jack London, Zora Neale Hurston, Linda Hogan, Ruth Ozeki, Philip K. Dick and Grant Morrison, as well selected texts from the growing field of critical animal theory. The course also offers an optional community engagement opportunity to work with Palo Alto Animal Services or another multi-species organization.
