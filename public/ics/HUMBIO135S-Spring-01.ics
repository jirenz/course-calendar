DESCRIPTION:Our increasing understanding of exercise physiology and biochemistry provide new insights into how we can &quot;hack&quot; the human body to increase the response to exercise training and improve human performance and health.  We will explore research and training interventions that try to capitalize on this new knowledge. Science communication will also be emphasized in the class, so students will learn the fundamentals of science storytelling and mixed media presentation of ideas. Requirements of this class include participating in blogs &amp; in-class discussions, evaluating physiology research, writing a research paper, and creating a science-based story by video or podcast to share with the class. If class is full, contact instructor for an application. Enrollment limited to 10. Prerequisites: B+ or higher in HUMBIO 135 and/or consent of instructor.
