DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 324)  This course provides an introduction to copyright law and policy. Students will learn the fundamental substantive and procedural features of copyright law, including subject matter requirements and limitations on protection with respect to validity, infringement, and defenses, as well as the boundaries between federal copyright law and other IP regimes. It will explore the source and nature of copyright protection, as well as the various justifications offered for such protection. In addition to familiarity with the Copyright Act and extensive case law, students will gain an understanding of copyright policy. Whose work should be protected, to what extent, and under what circumstances? Which unauthorized uses should count as infringing, and why? Special emphasis will be placed on the evolution of copyright in the digital era, since copyright law has evolved nearly constantly, in connection with new technologies, creative practices, and business models, as well as legislative and political shifts.  There is no prerequisite for this course.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.
