DESCRIPTION:Do slurring words differ in semantic character from their so-called neutral counterparts?  If so how do we explain the difference in meaning between a slur and its neutral counterpart. Or is slurring better explained by appeal to the resources of pragmatics, speech act theory or sociolinguistics? What is the source of the offensiveness of a slur?  How can mere words subordinate and marginalize?  We attempt to answer these and other questions about slurs and derogatory language.  nA previous course in either the philosophy of language or linguistic semantics or pragmatics is strongly recommended, though students without such background who are willing to do additional reading to fill in gaps in their knowledge are also welcome.
