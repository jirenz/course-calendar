DESCRIPTION:The health care system accounts for over 17% of US GDP and is one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. This two unit class focuses on the interplay and tension between the main players in the health care field - providers of health care services (individual doctors, group practices, integrated health care systems), payors (insurances companies, employers, consumers, and government), patients, and innovator companies (biopharma, medical device, diagnostics, and health care IT). The course is designed for students with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests who want to better understand the health care business and system. No prior experience in the health care or medical field is assumed or needed. nnThe focus of the class will be primarily on the US health care system, but there will be limited discussion of non-US systems as well.  The course is divided into four modules:  n&acirc;&cent;  An overview of the US Health Care System and the interplay between payers, providers, innovators, and patientsn&acirc;&cent;  Provider delivery models, health care information technology, and incentive structures n  -  The relationship between quality, cost, and access n  -  Integrated systems, value-based, and fee for service models n  -  New IT technologies, including electronic data recordsn  -  The role of information and incentives n  -  Innovator business models and issues n  -  Financing and managing new product development n  -  Clinical trial management and gaining regulatory approval n  -  Marketing, reimbursement, and sales strategies  n  -  Business models to drive innovation  n  -  Health care system reform nnThe class will be taught primarily from the perspective of a business person operating a company rather than that of a policy maker, academic, or investor.  While there will be a few lectures to provide background and frameworks for course topics, most classes will involve a case discussion and prominent guest speakers from the health care industry.  Speakers will include CEOs and senior executives from Genomic Health, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Blue Shield of California, Tenet Health, Venrock, Burd Health, Verily (Google Health) and Stanford Medicine.
