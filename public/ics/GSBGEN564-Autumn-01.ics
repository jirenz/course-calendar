DESCRIPTION:In this seminar we will explore the intersection of art and commerce in the entertainment industry. We will look at creating films and television programs that are artistically meaningful and/or have the potential for commercial success. Films are increasingly used as a tool for social change, and we will also examine this power. The entertainment industry is one of enormous importance - both from a business and cultural standpoint, and has influence in virtually every sphere of our society. Sometimes the industry can seem baffling, mercurial, and characterized more by madness than method. But despite its uncertainties, Hollywood does have its own rules, rhythms, methods and strategies - and examining and evaluating them will be a key part of this seminar. This is a time when many existing formulas are being reconsidered, retooled, or jettisoned, and new technologies and expanding markets are having a profound impact on the industry - and tracking and analyzing this will be a key part of the course. I will also bring some of my professional experiences into the classroom (including directing, writing, producing for film and television, etc.), and discuss these experiences through the intersection of the business and creative sides of the industry. We will have class discussions on entertainment industry's future, and address varied and effective paths for creating entertainment product that has artistic and/or commercial merit and is intended have widespread distribution. Students taking the course will be asked to be part of a group project and present their work in class.
