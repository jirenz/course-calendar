DESCRIPTION:This is an advanced elective course on the economics of active investing in public equity markets.  We will cover a set of foundational skills needed to select, and manage, a portfolio of public stocks. nnSpecifically, the course material is designed to improve student skills in: (1) assessing the relative attractiveness of individual companies, (2) building stock screens to filter and rank firms based on user-specified parameters, (3) buying and shorting individual equity positions, and (4) monitoring and managing portfolio risk.  nnThis is a hands-on course with an emphasis on experiential learning. Students will make extensive use of the analytical tools.  Some of the classes will be held in the &quot;Real-time Analytics and Investment Lab&quot; (R.A.I.L.) facility in the Bass Center.  There is no final exam. However, there will be a number of individual cases and a final group project. 25% of the grade will be based on class participation, and 75% will be based on cases and projects. nnBecause it is an advanced elective, students taking this class are expected to be well versed in core economic, accounting, and finance skills. Material covered in a second Financial Modeling course, as well as in Accounting 312 (Evaluating Financial Statement Information) and Accounting 313 (Accounting-based Valuation) will come in handy. However, none of these courses are required.
