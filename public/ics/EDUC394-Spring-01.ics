DESCRIPTION:NOTE: This will be a blended course comprising (1) two real-time face-to-face meetings during scheduled course time, one the first week of the quarter and one at the end; (2) two real-time but virtual &quot;meets ups&quot; during the quarter; (3) readings, discussions, and assignments done individually and in groups throughout the quarter; (4) a final project synthesizing student learning across course topics, to be presented and discussed in the last week's meeting. English learners (ELs) constitute nearly 10% of the U.S. public school population. At some point in their careers, the majority of educators will have English learners in their schools and classrooms. This course is designed for students interested in learning about the legal framework and research base for the education of ELs from the perspective of school and district leaders.
