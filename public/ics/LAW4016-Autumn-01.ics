The course materials include information typical to a patent lawsuit: a patent, file history, prior art, and information regarding the accused product. Students will represent either the patentee or the accused infringer. Students will draft claim construction charts, infringement charts, take and defend depositions, and brief and argue claim construction and motions for summary judgment of infringement and invalidity.  Some knowledge of patent law is presumed. Special Instructions: IP: Patents (Law 326) is a prerequisite for this course, but can be taken coterminously. Students must attend the first class session (or contact the instructor) or they will be dropped from the class or waitlist. Elements used in grading: Attendance, participation, writing assignments, exercises and oral arguments.
