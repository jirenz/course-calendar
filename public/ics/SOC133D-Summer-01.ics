DESCRIPTION:This course will explore the topic of globalization as an economic, political, cultural, and social process that has shaped an increasingly interconnected world.  How do we make sense of a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected, and where social problems are increasingly global in their scope?  How have international institutions attempted to regulate these processes and maintain social order?  How has globalization affected economic and social inequalities, democratization, and culture and identity, at both the national and international levels?  We will draw on a wide range of theories and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences to understand the multidimensional nature of these processes of globalization.
