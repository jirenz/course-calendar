DESCRIPTION:The September 2017 issue of Interview Magazine features Kim Kardashian West dressed as Jackie Kennedy on the cover, along with her daughter, North. In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family?
