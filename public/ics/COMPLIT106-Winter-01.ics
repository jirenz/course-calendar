DESCRIPTION:One of the most important aspects of human rights work is of course advocacy.  Thanks in large part to the development of the Internet, more and more people now have the ability to study, analyze, and write on human rights issues and disseminate their ideas widely.  The course will involve learning how to write effectively about human rights for the wider public. We will study and learn from successful examples of such writing from around the world. Students are strongly encouraged to explore this genre of writing in different languages. The course will both study contemporary human rights issues and use the TeachingHumanRights.org website as a platform for our blogs.
