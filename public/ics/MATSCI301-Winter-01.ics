DESCRIPTION:Government policy profoundly affects all aspects of the energy ecosystem, including its supply, distribution, storage and utilization.  Policy decisions also influence the pace and focus of innovation of new technologies, including through government-funded research and development programs.  This course will equip graduate students, who have strong science and engineering backgrounds, with a basic ability to understand and shape the ideation and implementation of sound energy policy.  Building on case studies of both aspirational and reactive US energy policy-making, students will design their own policy proposals for new, ambitious and achievable goals that advance a sustainable and prosperous future.
