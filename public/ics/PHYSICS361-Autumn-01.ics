DESCRIPTION:A comprehensive exposition of the standard model of cosmology, connecting a fundamental physics description to contemporary and proposed observations. Geometry, kinematics, dynamics, and current contents of the Universe at large. History of the universe as it expanded in size by a factor of a trillion, including nucleosynthesis, recombination, and reionization. Evolution of perturbations that eventually grow to form large scale structure, and the influence of this structure on observations of the microwave background and galaxies.  Introduction to modern cosmological probes including techniques to measure the expansion history and the growth of structure. The course will conclude with a focused discussion of cosmic inflation, the nature and origin of matter, and the cosmological constant. Recommended prerequisites: PHYSICS 261 or equivalent.
