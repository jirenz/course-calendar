DESCRIPTION:Students are introduced to and provided with medium-format film cameras, which they learn to use with an ongoing emphasis on operating manual settings (focus, aperture, shutter speed). Students are introduced to metering for film using hand-held light meters in a further study of light. They hone their printing skills and learn finer printing techniques using fiber-based paper. They also explore the full range of black and film stocks and get to experiment with alternative techniques like pinhole photography, photograms and Holga cameras. Students gain a deeper insight into and stronger grasp of practices in contemporary black and white photography, with a continuing focus on the importance of photo editing/selection and sequencing, as well as questions around the conceptual and practical implications and limits of photographic images. Prerequisite: ARTSTUDI 170 or equivalent.
