DESCRIPTION:The world of work has changed fundamentally - firms are now integrally linked to the global economy and many of you will manage teams of people located in different countries. What are the typical &quot;people&quot; challenges that arise when working across borders? We will answer this question by looking at topics such as hiring, job design, teamwork, training, pay and promotions. We will use exercises, cases from both developed and developing economies and guest lectures.
