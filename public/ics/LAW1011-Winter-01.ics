DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 264)  Lawyers often need an advanced understanding of corporate financial decisions, instruments, and transactions, including equity financing and initial public offerings, the determination of a firm&iquest;s cost of capital, valuation, payout policy, recapitalizations and bankruptcy, and mergers and corporate control. Advanced Corporate Finance introduces these topics by lecture and then explores them through detailed analysis of actual cases. This structure maximizes the synergy between theory and practice, providing students with portable, durable, and marketable tools for their careers. Legal considerations that arise in the execution of these corporate financial decisions include mandatory disclosure requirements, the issuance of dual class shares, charges of anticompetitive practices, taxes, appraisal cases and fairness opinions, takeover defenses and fiduciary duty challenges, contractual provisions in merger agreements, insider trading, and Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This class rigorously advances both conceptual and practical/analytical understanding. The knowledge gained will facilitate professional dealings with boards of directors, chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, investment bankers, consultants, portfolio and investment managers, venture capitalists, and private equity investors.  Prerequisite: Corporate Finance I (Law 262) or equivalent background. Elements used in grading: class participation and final exam.
