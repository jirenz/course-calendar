DESCRIPTION:What is a mathematical proof, and where do proofs come from? Students will become comfortable with fundamental techniques of mathematical proof through practice with interesting and accessible examples from many areas of math. Students will additionally hone their communication skills and develop their ability to formulate and answer precise mathematical questions. Topics include direct proof, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, many applications of mathematical induction, constructing good definitions, and useful writing habits. The course is designed to prepare students who have completed or are concurrently enrolled in MATH 51 to succeed in introductory proof-based math classes at the level of MATH 115 or MATH 120, or to simply appreciate the nature of proof at a deeper level than is seen in high school geometry. To be considered for enrollment, please email masonr@stanford.edu and attend the first class meeting on Tuesday, April 3 at 3PM in 300-303.
