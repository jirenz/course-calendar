DESCRIPTION:This course explores the historical development and artistic potential of photography books. Students will learn about book structures, signatures, binding styles, printing methods and publication platforms (from conventional print to web-based). They will focus on how to group and sequence photographic images to produce a coherent, thematically organized body of work, and examine the creative possibilities of integrating image and text. Students will have access to numerous campus resources to do research and develop ideas, including the extensive photo book collections of the Bowes Art &amp; Architecture Library and the Cantor Museum. They will have to execute a photographic project of their own design and produce a hand-made book. Prerequisite: ARTSTUDI 170, ARTSTUDI 171, or equivalent.
