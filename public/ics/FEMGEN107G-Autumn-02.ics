LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In this course, we will explore the history, the development, the critiques and praise of sororities and fraternities.  We&iquest;ll pay particular attention to how gender and sexuality are framed in those discussions&iquest;ones by outsiders as well as ones by insiders.  How do Greek organizations present their activities and goals?  What values and roles do they highlight during recruitment?  Who joins them?  What expectations are there for participants?  What are the perceived benefits that come with joining?  What does it mean to be a &iquest;fraternity brother&iquest; or a &iquest;sorority sister&iquest; in modern Greek organizations? How are sorority women and fraternity men discussed by outsiders?  How do the stereotypes of Greek life impact perceptions of individuals as well as particular sororities and fraternities? To consider these questions, we&iquest;ll look at historical documents and analyze how groups described themselves as they were establishing; we&iquest;ll also analyze recent documents (websites, books, etc.) to consider current ways organizations describe themselves, their activities, and their values.  We&iquest;ll use both to consider how the messages created by and about Greek organizations shape public perceptions as well as individuals&iquest; experiences of gender and sexuality identity.
