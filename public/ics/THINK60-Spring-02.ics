DESCRIPTION:It would seem that an enemy should be easy to identify, but this course proposes that this involves deliberation, choice, and an assessment of consequences.  We will explore modern American experiences in defining enemies, here defined as mortal threats to the state and the national collective.  We will focus on ideas, thinking and assumptions rather than historical chronology.  Who are enemies?  How are they defined and by whom?  How are enemies characterized and perceived?  The narrative content of the course would be a historical study of the American engagement with enemies from 1942 to 1990.  We will begin with the war or terror, return to consider the experience of the Japanese enemy of World War II, and then come up through the years of the Cold War and beyond.
