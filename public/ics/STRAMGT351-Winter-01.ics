DESCRIPTION:The focus of this class is on the challenges and key issues associated with the creation and management of a professional sales organization.  Our emphasis is developing and managing the selling effort of business-to-business and business-to-consumer capital goods and services.  There will be relatively little emphasis on sales technique (i.e., students should not expect a course on &quot;How to be a Better Salesperson&quot;).  The course is organized to follow the development of the sales function from strategic inception through to execution and implementation:  choosing a go-to-market model (e.g., direct sales, no/low touch, VARs, OEMs, hybrid models); building and structuring the sales organization (e.g., sales learning curve, organizational structure, allocating territories and quotas); and managing the sales force (e.g., hiring/firing, compensation, forecasting, culture).  We will address these topics in the context of both early stage ventures and later stage enterprises.
