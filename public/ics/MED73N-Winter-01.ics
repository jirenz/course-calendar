DESCRIPTION:Offers an introduction to the scientific method  and common biases in science. Examines theoretical  considerations and practical examples where biases have led to  erroneous conclusions, as well as scientific practices that can help  identify, correct or prevent such biases. Additionally focuses on appropriate  methods to interweave inductive and deductive approaches. Topics covered include: Popper&iquest;s falsification  and Kuhn&iquest;s paradigm shift, revolution vs. evolution; determinism  and uncertainty; probability, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian approaches;  agnostic testing and big data; team science; peer review;  replication; correlation and causation; bias in design, analysis, reporting  and sponsorship of research; bias in the public perception  of science, mass media and research; and bias in human history and  everyday life. Provides students an understanding  of how scientific knowledge has been and will be generated;  the causes of bias in experimental design and in analytical  approaches; and the interactions between deductive  and inductive approaches in the generation of knowledge.
