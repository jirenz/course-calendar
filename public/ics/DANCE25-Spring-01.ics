DESCRIPTION:Make your own dance! In Studio-to-Stage, student choreographers propose, develop, rehearse, and perform their own dances under the close guidance of a faculty mentor. Together, mentor and dance maker discover rehearsal processes that will support and realize the proposed work, including movement investigation, music/sound choices, costuming, and lighting.  The course culminates in a group concert showing.  Dance is broadly defined as any intentional movement, including fusion forms and innovation. Dance makers of all levels, styles, and training backgrounds are strongly encouraged to enroll.  Concert format, logistics, and level of theatrical production will be determined by the  collective ambition and imagination of the participants. TAPS  will provide some technical support towards the culminating showing of works.
