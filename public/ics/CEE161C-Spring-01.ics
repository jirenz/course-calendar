DESCRIPTION:An introduction to natural ventilation design, including an in-depth discussion of the fluid mechanics of natural ventilation, and a review of models and measurements of naturally ventilated buildings. Overview of the design process, from assessing feasibility to commissioning. Discussion of physical processes in natural ventilation, including buoyancy- and wind- driven flow, and important fluid mechanics and heat transfer concepts and equations. Steady flow characteristics of openings, steady and unsteady envelope models. Internal air motion, zonal models and stratification. CFD and its applications, scale modeling and full-scale measurements. Throughout the course the Y2E2 building natural ventilation system and temperature measurements will be used to illustrate the different concepts and methods.
