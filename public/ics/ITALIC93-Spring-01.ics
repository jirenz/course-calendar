LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:ITALIC is an arts-minded, residence-based academic program for freshmen.  It's built around a series of big questions about the historical, critical and practical purposes of art. It also builds community. This yearlong experience fosters close exchanges among faculty, students, guest artists and scholars in class, over meals and during excursions to arts events. We&iquest;ll trace the challenges that works of art have presented to history, politics, and culture, particularly since the 19th century. We'll look at ways arts can inform creative problem-solving, confront uncertainty and ambiguity, and experiment with different sets of rules. Through rigorous inquiry, ITALIC seeks to create new frameworks for exploring our (and others') experience.
