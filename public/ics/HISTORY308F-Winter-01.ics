DESCRIPTION:(Formerly LAW 516, now LAW 3515.) The Law and Humanities Workshop: History, Literature, and Philosophy is designed as a forum in which faculty and students from the Law School and from various humanities departments can discuss some of the best work now being done in law and humanities. Every other week, an invited speaker will present his or her current research for discussion. In the week prior to a given speaker's presentation, the class will meet as a group to discuss secondary literature relevant to understanding and critiquing the speaker's research. Students will then read the speaker's paper in advance of the following week's workshop presentation. Enrollment will be limited to 30 students-- 20 from SLS who will be selected by lottery and 10 from H&amp;S. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, and writing assignments.
