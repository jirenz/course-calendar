LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Patent reform has been a hotly debated topic in recent years in the intellectual property field.  Different industries and players have differing and often competing views of our patent system--how effective it is in promoting innovation and what, if any, reform is needed.  Students will play the role of counsel on one or more teams representing the interests of particular stakeholder groups. The teams will engage in a series of mock negotiations on actual legislative or administrative patent reform proposals with other teams, as well as mock legislative or administrative engagements before Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office respectively.  The goal is to achieve consensus on patent reforms that best serve the stakeholders' individual and collective interests, all in an environment of competing interests. Through experience-based learning and simulations, students will gain an understanding of some of the most current patent policy issues being debated in Congress and before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  This seminar will also teach students how to: (1) evaluate from their client's perspective complex, legislative and administrative, patent policy proposals; and (2) strategize, prepare for, participate in, negotiate and advocate for beneficial reforms.  Prerequisites:  Introduction to Intellectual Property.  Grading Criteria: The seminar requires that students to do the required reading, actively participate in class and the mock negotiations and legislative or administrative engagements, and write a series of at least three short assignments.
